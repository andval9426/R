abstract={Importance: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent childhood-onset disorder associated with lifelong adversity and high costs for the individual and society at large. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an established evidence-based treatment for SAD, but its availability is limited. Objective: To assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of therapist-guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for SAD in youths vs an active comparator, internet-delivered supportive therapy (ISUPPORT). Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-masked, superiority randomized clinical trial enrolled participants at a clinical research unit integrated within the child and adolescent mental health services in Stockholm, Sweden, from September 1, 2017, to October 31, 2018. The final participant reached the 3-month follow-up (primary end point) in May 2019. Children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with a principal diagnosis of SAD and their parents were included in the study. Interventions: ICBT and ISUPPORT, both including 10 online modules, 5 separate parental modules, and 3 video call sessions with a therapist. Main Outcomes and Measures: The Clinician Severity Rating (CSR), derived from the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule, rated by masked assessors 3 months after the end of treatment. The CSR ranges from 0 to 8, with scores of 4 or higher indicating caseness. Secondary outcomes included masked assessor-rated diagnostic status of SAD and global functioning, child- and parent-reported social anxiety and depressive symptoms, and health-related costs. Results: Of the 307 youths assessed for eligibility, 103 were randomized to 10 weeks of therapist-guided ICBT (n = 51) or therapist-guided ISUPPORT (n = 52) for SAD. The sample consisted of 103 youths (mean [SD] age, 14.1 [2.1] years; 79 [77%] female). Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy was significantly more efficacious than ISUPPORT in reducing the severity of SAD symptoms. Mean (SD) CSR scores for ICBT at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up were 5.06 (0.95) and 3.96 (1.46), respectively, compared with 4.94 (0.94) and 4.48 (1.30) for ISUPPORT. There was a significant between-group effect size of d = 0.67 (95% CI, 0.21-1.12) at the 3-month follow-up. Similarly, all of the secondary outcome measures demonstrated significant differences with small to large effect sizes, except for child-rated quality of life (nonsignificant). The cost-effectiveness analyses indicated cost savings associated with ICBT compared with ISUPPORT, with the main drivers of the savings being lower medication costs (z = 2.38, P =.02) and increased school productivity (z = 1.99, P =.047) in the ICBT group. There was 1 suicide attempt in the ISUPPORT group; no other serious adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy was an efficacious and cost-effective intervention for children and adolescents with SAD. Implementation in clinical practice could markedly increase the availability of effective interventions for SAD.

abstract={Top-tier evidence on the safety/tolerability of 80 medications in children/adolescents with mental disorders has recently been reviewed in this jour­nal. To guide clinical practice, such data must be combined with evidence on efficacy and acceptability. Besides medications, psychosocial inter­ventions and brain stimulation techniques are treatment options for children/adolescents with mental disorders. For this umbrella review, we systematically searched network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses (MAs) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating 48 medications, 20 psychosocial interventions, and four brain stimulation techniques in children/adolescents with 52 different mental disorders or groups of mental disorders, reporting on 20 different efficacy/acceptability outcomes. Co-primary outcomes were disease-specific symptom reduction and all-cause discontinuation (“acceptability”). We included 14 NMAs and 90 MAs, reporting on 15 mental disorders or groups of mental disorders. Overall, 21 medications outperformed placebo regarding the co-primary outcomes, and three psychosocial interventions did so (while seven outperformed waiting list/no treatment). Based on the meta-analytic evidence, the most convincing efficacy profile emerged for amphetamines, methylphenidate and, to a smaller extent, behavioral therapy in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; aripiprazole, risperidone and several psychosocial interventions in autism; risperidone and behavioral interventions in disruptive behavior disorders; several antipsychotics in schizophrenia spectrum disorders; fluoxetine, the combination of fluoxetine and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and interpersonal therapy in depression; aripiprazole in mania; fluoxetine and group CBT in anxiety disorders; fluoxetine/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, CBT, and behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention in obsessive-compulsive disorder; CBT in post-traumatic stress disorder; imipramine and alarm behavioral intervention in enuresis; behavioral therapy in encopresis; and family therapy in anorexia nervosa. Results from this umbrella review of interventions for mental disorders in children/adolescents provide evidence-based information for clinical decision making. © 2021 World Psychiatric Association},

abstract={Besides cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychopharmacotherapy belongs to the first-line treatment approaches for anxiety disorders according to all national and international guidelines. According to studies and meta-analyses, modern antidepressants in particular have been proven to be effective. Depending on the substance, there are approvals for panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia. There are also approvals for other substance groups, e.g. anticonvulsants for generalized anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines should be used with caution in view of the risk of dependency. Although effective and well-tolerated medications are available, up to 30% of patients still do not respond or do not respond adequately to treatment. Consequently, research efforts to develop new substances are important. Based on a better understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders, a large number of substances are currently undergoing clinical trials. Modulators of current and new transmitter systems, in particular the glutamatergic and the endocannabinoid systems as well as neuropeptides, are being discussed as innovative substances. Strategies are also being investigated which, in combination with psychotherapy, aim at optimizing fear extinction memory. First studies are also underway on the use of psychedelic agents in combination with psychotherapy for anxiety. © 2021, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.},

abstract={Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a feeding and eating disorder that results in nutritional inadequacies, weight loss, and/or dependence on enteral feeds, and for which three clinical subtypes have been described. We present a unique case of an 11-year-old boy with rigid ARFID since infancy and features of all three ARFID subtypes. The patient presented with a life-long history of sensory aversion, limited intake and phobia of vomiting resulting in restriction to a single food item (yogurt) for more than 5 years. He presented with severe iron-deficiency anaemia, and deficiencies of vitamins A, C, D, E and zinc. We employed a multimodal therapeutic approach that incorporated elements of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), family-based therapy (FBT) and pharmacological management with an antidepressant medication (sertraline) and an atypical antipsychotic agent (olanzapine). Over the course of a 7-week admission, our approach assisted the patient in successful weight restoration and incorporation of at least three new food items into his daily diet. While there are currently no first-line recommendations for ARFID management, our study lends support to the efficacy of CBT, FBT and pharmacological management for ARFID patients, including complex cases with multiple subtype features. Further research is needed to strengthen ARFID clinical guidelines. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Starting in 2019, the 2014 German Guidelines for Anxiety Disorders (Bandelow et al. Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 265:363–373, 2015) have been revised by a consensus group consisting of 35 experts representing the 29 leading German specialist societies and patient self-help organizations. While the first version of the guideline was based on 403 randomized controlled studies (RCTs), 92 additional RCTs have been included in this revision. According to the consensus committee, anxiety disorders should be treated with psychotherapy, pharmacological drugs, or their combination. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was regarded as the psychological treatment with the highest level of evidence. Psychodynamic therapy (PDT) was recommended when CBT was not effective or unavailable or when PDT was preferred by the patient informed about more effective alternatives. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended as first-line drugs for anxiety disorders. Medications should be continued for 6–12 months after remission. When either medications or psychotherapy were not effective, treatment should be switched to the other approach or to their combination. For patients non-responsive to standard treatments, a number of alternative strategies have been suggested. An individual treatment plan should consider efficacy, side effects, costs and the preference of the patient. Changes in the revision include recommendations regarding virtual reality exposure therapy, Internet interventions and systemic therapy. The recommendations are not only applicable for Germany but may also be helpful for developing treatment plans in all other countries. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Anxiety is a group of mental disorders characterized by the sudden feeling of intense fear, panic, shortness of breath, chest pain, restlessness, GIT problems, insomnia, fatigue, muscle tension, sweating, loss of memory, blurred vision, and impaired learning. It occurs typically in response to a stressful situation that may become pathological when it is no longer controlled or occurs in the absence of real threat. This review aimed to appraise the literature on the prevalence, classification, neuro-pathogenesis, diagnoses, and treatment of anxiety disorders (AD). The search was made using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders affecting humans, especially among developing nations. In general, the lifetime prevalence of AD is about 14%, with an annual prevalence of 31%. Unfortunately, AD, in general, is underdiagnosed and undertreated globally. Anxiety disorders are classified based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health Disorder V (DSM-V). Examples of AD include generalized anxiety disorder, panic attack, agoraphobia, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, selective mutism, medication anxiety disorder, and medical condition anxiety disorder. Generally, anxiety is caused by biological, genetic, autonomic, biochemical, and environmental changes. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. It is known for the induction of sleep, relaxation, and prevention of excitation; therefore, depletion of GABA in the occipital cortex is implicated in anxiety pathogenesis. Besides, hormones such as serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, and glutamate are involved in anxiety etiology. Treatments of anxiety disorders involve the use of drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Classes of drugs used in the management of anxiety include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, a tricyclic antidepressant, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, azapirones, and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase. © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

abstract={Adjudicative competence evaluations are the most common forensic evaluation to occur in the United States. As a result of these evaluations, pretrial defendants are often found to be incompetent to stand trial and ordered for competency restoration, with psychotic symptoms as a major barrier to competency. Traditional competency restoration services are sometimes insufficient for restoring such defendants to competency within a reasonable period of time. This can lead to a finding that a defendant is unrestorably incompetent to stand trial and potentially a dismissal of charges. However, if not all available interventions are attempted during the course of competency restoration, this may be perceived as a miscarriage of justice for victims. In other cases, defendants with psychotic symptoms may lack insight into their mental illness, and after being successfully restored to competency, become non-adherent with their prescribed medication regimens and decompensate before their cases are resolved. The authors contend that use of Cognitive Behavior Therapy for psychosis (CBT-p) as an adjunct to traditional competency restoration services may be a means of restoring more defendants to competency, and also strengthening the durability of restored competency, when psychotic symptoms are identified as a barrier to adjudicative competence. This makes use of the skill sets of many clinically trained treatment providers working in forensic settings, and is consistent with recent trends of applying empirically-based interventions designed for use with non-forensic patients in forensic contexts. A case example is included to demonstrate the potential application of CBT-p to competency restoration during the course of individualized intervention. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) commonly co-occur and are considered challenging to manage when they co-occur in youth. However, clinical characteristics and prognosis of this group remain poorly understood. This study examined the prevalence, clinical correlates and outcomes of paediatric OCD co-occurring with ASD (OCD + ASD) in a large clinical cohort. Data were extracted from electronic clinical records of young people aged 4–17 years who had attended a mental health trust in South London, United Kingdom. We identified young people with diagnoses of OCD + ASD (n = 335), OCD without ASD (n = 1010), and ASD without OCD (n = 6577). 25% of youth with OCD had a diagnosis of ASD, while 5% of those with ASD had a diagnosis of OCD. At diagnosis, youth with OCD + ASD had lower psychosocial functioning scores on the clinician-rated Child Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) compared to those with either OCD or ASD. Youth with OCD + ASD were equally likely to receive CBT compared to those with OCD but were more likely to be prescribed medication and use services for longer than either comparison group. Youth with OCD + ASD showed significant improvements in functioning (CGAS scores) after service utilisation but their gains were smaller than those with OCD. OCD + ASD commonly co-occur, conferring substantial impairment, although OCD may be underdiagnosed in youth with ASD. Young people with co-occurring OCD + ASD can make significant improvements in functioning with routine clinical care but are likely to remain more impaired than typically developing youth with OCD, indicating a need for longer-term support for these young people. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. As reviewed in this guideline, both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication have considerable empirical support as safe and effective short-term treatments for anxiety in children and adolescents. Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medication has some empirical support as an additional treatment option. In the context of a protracted severe shortage of child and adolescent−trained behavioral health specialists, research demonstrating convenient, efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly delivery mechanisms for safe and effective treatments for child and adolescent anxiety disorders is an urgent priority. The comparative effectiveness of anxiety treatments, delineation of mediators and moderators of effective anxiety treatments, long-term effects of SSRI and SNRI use in children and adolescents, and additional evaluation of the degree of suicide risk associated with SSRIs and SNRIs remain other key research needs. © 2020},

abstract={Multimodal in-patient treatment incorporating intensive cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) and medication management is a promising alternative for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients who do not respond to standard out-patient treatment. We prospectively examined the short-term outcome and predictors of outcome of intensive in-patient treatment in a largely pharmacotherapy-resistant OCD sample. Fifty eight consecutive patients, admitted for treatment of OCD were evaluated at admission, at discharge and 2 months post-discharge for psychiatric diagnosis, personality disorders, obsessive beliefs, insight into obsessions and severity of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and anxiety symptoms. All patients received comprehensive treatment consisting of a combination of pharmacotherapy and intensive CBT. The mean Y-BOCS score was 29.38(±5.72) at admission, which reduced to 16.62(±7.91) at discharge and 16.75(±8.85) at follow-up. Thirty five participants (60.3%) met the prespecified criteria for response and 19 (32.8%) for remission. There was a significant reduction in Y-BOCS scores at discharge [43.67 (23.81)%] and post-discharge follow-up [2.18 (29.32)%] as compared to baseline (p<0.01). Baseline Browns Assessment of Beleifs Scale score (insight) was the only variable that statistically differentiated responders and non-responders. In-patient treatment is an effective treatment for medication resistant, severe and chronic OCD. Poor insight is a potential predictor of non-response to in-patient treatment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for panic disorder, but many fewer patients receive this treatment compared to medication-based therapy. Mobile app-based interactive CBT using a chatbot can increase patient access to CBT. We performed a preliminary study to determine whether short-term use of a newly developed chatbot is feasible and effective for relieving panic symptoms. Method: Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to either a chatbot group (n = 21) or control group (n = 20) for a period of 4 weeks. The chatbot group was guided in the use of the chatbot application, while the control group was provided with a book on panic disorder. Main results: The severity of panic disorder was significantly decreased in the chatbot group, but not in the control group. The social phobia score was significantly decreased and the control helplessness score was significantly increased in the chatbot group compared to the control group. Discussion and conclusion: We found that mobile app-based interactive CBT using the chatbot was feasible and effective for reducing the severity of panic symptoms. Using this novel approach to provide CBT would allow clinicians to effect positive therapeutic outcomes with easy accessibility, interactivity, and self-management for patients with panic symptoms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Little is known about the longer-term outcomes of children diagnosed with selective mutism (SM) and/or social anxiety disorder (SAD); two anxiety disorders characterized by difficulties speaking in social situations despite being able to speak in other contexts. Objective: This retrospective study aimed to descriptively evaluate the long-term SM and SAD diagnostic and symptom severity outcomes in a clinical youth sample. Methods: Retrospective follow-up interviews were conducted with 31 parents of children/youth aged four to 14 years previously referred to a specialized anxiety clinic and diagnosed with SM and/or SAD (mean follow-up 4.2 years). Clinician and parent-report measures were used to determine follow-up diagnosis and symptom severity. Results: The majority (71%; n=22) of participants still met criteria for SM and/or SAD. Of these, 11 had SAD only; nine had a comorbid diagnosis of SM and SAD; and two had SM only. At follow-up 42% (n=13) were receiving school supports. Close to half (48%; n=15) of parents continued to express concerns about their child’s anxiety. Almost all (90%, n=28) youth had attempted some form of treatment, with group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) reported as the most common form of treatment tried (48%, n=15). Almost thirty percent (29%, n=9) reported taking anxiety medications in the past with several (13%, n=4) still on medications at follow-up. Conclusion: Study results suggest that symptoms of SM and SAD persist in the longer-term. Further investigation into the differences between diagnostic groups and their long-term treatment outcomes is clearly warranted. © 2020, Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

abstract={Background: Correct prediction of treatment response is a central goal of precision psychiatry. Here, we tested the predictive accuracy of a variety of pre-treatment patient characteristics, including clinical, demographic, molecular genetic, and neuroimaging markers, for treatment response in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Methods: Forty-seven SAD patients (mean±SD age 33.9 ± 9.4 years, 24 women) were randomized and commenced 9 weeks’ Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) combined either with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (20 mg daily [10 mg first week], SSRI+CBT, n = 24) or placebo (placebo+CBT, n = 23). Treatment responders were defined from the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I ≤ 2). Before treatment, patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Multi-Source Interference Task taxing cognitive interference. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained to separate responders from nonresponders based on pre-treatment neural reactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), amygdala, and occipital cortex, as well as molecular genetic, demographic, and clinical data. SVM models were tested using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results: The best model separated treatment responders (n = 24) from nonresponders based on pre-treatment dACC reactivity (83% accuracy, P = 0.001). Responders had greater pre-treatment dACC reactivity than nonresponders especially in the SSRI+CBT group. No other variable was associated with clinical response or added predictive accuracy to the dACC SVM model. Limitations: Small sample size, especially for genetic analyses. No replication or validation samples were available. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that treatment outcome predictions based on neural cingulate activity, at the individual level, outperform genetic, demographic, and clinical variables for medication-assisted Internet-delivered CBT, supporting the use of neuroimaging in precision psychiatry. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Although evidence-based assessments are the cornerstone of evidence-based treatments, it remains unknown whether incorporating evidence-based assessments into clinical practice enhances therapists’ judgment of therapeutic improvement. This study examined whether the inclusion of youth- and parent-reported anxiety rating scales improved therapists’ judgment of treatment response and remission compared to the judgment of treatment-masked independent evaluators (IEs) after (a) weekly/biweekly acute treatment and (b) monthly follow-up care. Methods: Four hundred thirty six youth received cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication, CBT with medication, or pill placebo through the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study. Participants and parents completed the following anxiety scales at pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up: Screen for Childhood Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARED) and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC). IEs rated anxiety on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) at posttreatment and follow-up. Therapists rated anxiety severity and improvement using scales that paralleled IE measures. Results: Fair-to-moderate agreement was found between therapists and IEs after acute treatment (κ = 0.38–0.48), with only slight-to-fair agreement found after follow-up care (κ = 0.07–0.33). Optimal algorithms for determining treatment response and remission included the combination of therapists’ ratings and the parent-reported SCARED after acute (κ = 0.52–0.54) and follow-up care (κ = 0.43–0.48), with significant improvement in the precision of judgments after follow-up care (p <.02–.001). Conclusion: Therapists are good at detecting treatment response and remission, but the inclusion of the parent-report SCARED optimized agreement with IE rating—especially when contact was less frequent. Findings suggest that utilizing parent-report measures of anxiety in clinical practice improves the precision of therapists’ judgment. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={A recent individual patient data meta-analysis showed that antidepressant medication is slightly more efficacious than cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing overall depression severity in patients with a DSM-defined depressive disorder. We used an update of that dataset, based on seventeen randomized clinical trials, to examine the comparative efficacy of antidepressant medication vs. CBT in more detail by focusing on individual depressive symptoms as assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Five symptoms (i.e., “depressed mood”, “feelings of guilt”, “suicidal thoughts”, “psychic anxiety” and “general somatic symptoms”) showed larger improvements in the medication compared to the CBT condition (effect sizes ranging from.13 to.16), whereas no differences were found for the twelve other symptoms. In addition, network estimation techniques revealed that all effects, except that on “depressed mood”, were direct and could not be explained by any of the other direct or indirect treatment effects. Exploratory analyses showed that information about the symptom-specific efficacy could help in identifying those patients who, based on their pre-treatment symptomatology, are likely to benefit more from antidepressant medication than from CBT (effect size of.30) versus those for whom both treatments are likely to be equally efficacious. Overall, our symptom-oriented approach results in a more thorough evaluation of the efficacy of antidepressant medication over CBT and shows potential in “precision psychiatry”. © 2019 World Psychiatric Association},

abstract={Among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions stand anxiety and depression. Psychotherapy and medications are considered effective treatments in these clinical settings. However, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)) administered in monotherapy or in a combined regimen do not result in satisfactory outcomes in all patients. Therefore, finding new treatments would be of great help. In the last three decades, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has emerged as a safe tool to improve several neuropsychiatric symptoms. The following work revisits the available reports that assessed the add-on value of NIBS techniques when combined to psychotherapy (CBT or related interventions) in mood and anxiety disorders. The available protocols targeted the prefrontal cortex, a region that was previously found to have an enhanced activity or functional connectivity after psychotherapeutic interventions. Promising yet scarce evidence exists on this matter. A discrepancy exists among the available reports regarding the type and duration of interventions, the patients’ clinical profiles, and the presence of a sham intervention. NIBS may have acted by enhancing psychotherapy effects on the top-down cognitive control of emotions. Combining both therapies may result in promising effects, but future large-scale trials are needed to judge the utility of this combination in psychiatric populations © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Anxiety and fear are normal responses to human events and do not require clinical intervention unless the fear is of unusual duration, intensity, content or frequency, according to the DSM-V criteria. There are several types of anxiety disorders according to the DSM-V: Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorders, phobias and separation anxiety. The DSM-V separates out anxiety from obsessive-compulsive disorders and trauma and stress related disorders such as PTSD. The prevalence of anxiety disorders across all of adolescence approaches 36%. Youth experiencing anxiety may have a strong physiologic reaction to the stress that reinforces the feelings of anxiety. The effects of anxiety on adolescent well-being and function depend on the level of severity of the anxiety, from mild to severe, which can debilitate the adolescent in many areas of his/her life. Longitudinal data suggest that anxiety disorders in youth predict a range of psychiatric disorders later in life, including other anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and depression. The primary care provider has a very important role to play in screening for, diagnosing and treating anxiety in adolescents. Validated clinical screening tools exist and can help the clinician make a diagnosis. For mild anxiety, reassurance, encouragement and follow-up may be sufficient to address the anxiety. For moderate to severe anxiety, both evidence-based counseling, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or action and commitment therapy (ACT) and anti-anxiety medications (primarily the SSRIs) can effectively treat anxiety. ACT, with its mindfulness approach and use of metaphors, may be easier to integrate into primary care. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Anxiety disorders are common, yet treatment options in general practice are often limited to medication or CBT. There is a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of anxiety in patients who present to general practice and also about the intensity of exercise required to lead to improvement. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the use of exercise versus waiting list control groups in the treatment of anxiety and also to assess the benefit of high intensity exercise vs low intensity exercise. Long term follow up scores were also analysed. We included patients who met diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders or had clinically raised anxiety levels on a validated rating scale and performed a subgroup analysis of the outcomes between the two groups. The intervention was any aerobic exercise programme carried out for at least two weeks, or exercise carried out at high intensity for at least two weeks. The comparison groups were either a waiting list control group or low intensity exercise. Method: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Three databases were searched; CENTRAL, Medline and Embase. Outcome assessment was based on validated anxiety rating scales. The quality of the studies was appraised according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Effect sizes were calculated using the standardised mean difference. Results: Fifteen studies were identified with a total of 675 patients. Nine trials had participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders and six trials had participants with raised anxiety on a validated rating scale. Aerobic exercise was effective in the treatment of raised anxiety compared to waiting list control groups (effect size - 0.41, 95% CI = - 0.70 to - 0.12). High intensity exercise programmes showed greater effects than low intensity programmes. There was no significant difference in outcomes between groups of patients with diagnosed anxiety disorders and patients who had raised anxiety on a rating scale. Conclusions were limited by the small number of studies and wide variation in the delivery of exercise interventions. Conclusion: Exercise programmes are a viable treatment option for the treatment of anxiety. High intensity exercise regimens were found to be more effective than low intensity regimens. The results have implications for the use of exercise schemes in General Practice. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Currently there is no universally accepted definition of remission in anxiety disorders. This may be causing significantly different estimates of treatment efficacy across anxiety disorders. The aim of this paper was to determine not only the overall remission rate in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders, but also to examine whether the different definitions of remission lead to significantly different remission rates. From the initial 228 abstracts reviewed by the authors, 100 articles were retained. The overall mean remission rate was 51.0%. Remission rates were highest when remission was defined as good end state functioning or no longer meeting criteria for the primary diagnosis. Studies of posttraumatic stress disorder had the highest remission rates, while those of obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder had the lowest remission rates. Rates of remission differed by certain demographic (e.g., older age) and clinical (e.g., medication use) characteristics. Although CBT is an empirically supported treatment for anxiety disorders, it is clear that there is room for improvement, as many patients do not achieve remission status. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: A 2010 meta-analysis of internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) RCTs argued ‘computer therapy for the anxiety and depressive disorders was effective, acceptable and practical health care’ without data on effectiveness or practicality in routine practice. Methods: Databases, reviews and meta-analyses were searched for randomised controlled trials of cCBT or iCBT versus a control group (care as usual, waitlist, information control, psychological placebo, pill placebo, etc.) in people who met diagnostic criteria for major depression, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or generalised anxiety disorder. Number randomised, superiority of treatment versus control (Hedges'g) on primary outcome measure, length of follow-up, follow up outcome, patient adherence and satisfaction/harm were extracted; risk of bias was assessed. A search for studies on effectiveness of iCBT in clinical practice was conducted. Results: 64 trials were identified. The mean effect size (efficacy) was g = 0.80 (NNT 2.34), and benefit was evident across all four disorders. Improvement was maintained at follow-with good acceptability. Research probity was good, and bias risk low. In addition, nine studies comparing iCBT with traditional face-to-face CBT and three comparing iCBT with bibliotherapy were identified. All three modes of treatment delivery appeared equally beneficial. The results of effectiveness studies were congruent with the results of the efficacy trials. Limitations: Studies variably measured changes in quality of life and disability, and the lack of comparisons with medications weakens the field. Conclusions: The conclusions drawn in the original meta-analysis are now supported: iCBT for the anxiety and depressive disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={IMPORTANCE: Childhood anxiety is common. Multiple treatment options are available, but existing guidelines provide inconsistent advice on which treatment to use. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and adverse events of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy for childhood anxiety disorders. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and SciVerse Scopus from database inception through February 1, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies that enrolled children and adolescents with confirmed diagnoses of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety and who received CBT, pharmacotherapy, or the combination. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary anxiety symptoms (measured by child, parent, or clinician), remission, response, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 7719 patients were included from 115 studies. Of these, 4290 (55.6%) were female, and the mean (range) age was 9.2 (5.4-16.1) years. Compared with pill placebo, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) significantly reduced primary anxiety symptoms and increased remission (relative risk, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.37-3.04) and response (relative risk, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.60-2.40). Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) significantly reduced clinician-reported primary anxiety symptoms. Benzodiazepines and tricyclics were not found to significantly reduce anxiety symptoms. When CBT was compared with wait-listing/no treatment, CBT significantly improved primary anxiety symptoms, remission, and response. Cognitive behavioral therapy reduced primary anxiety symptoms more than fluoxetine and improved remission more than sertraline. The combination of sertraline and CBT significantly reduced clinician-reported primary anxiety symptoms and response more than either treatment alone. Head-to-head comparisons were sparse, and network meta-analysis estimates were imprecise. Adverse events were common with medications but not with CBT and were not severe. Studies were too small or too short to assess suicidality with SSRIs or SNRIs. One trial showed a statistically nonsignificant increase in suicidal ideation with venlafaxine. Cognitive behavioral therapy was associated with fewer dropouts than pill placebo or medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Evidence supports the effectiveness of CBT and SSRIs for reducing childhood anxiety symptoms. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors also appear to be effective based on less consistent evidence. Head-to-head comparisons between various medications and comparisons with CBT represent a need for research in the field. © 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study examined (a) demographic and clinical characteristics associated with sleep-related problems (SRPs) among youth with anxiety disorders, and (b) the impact of anxiety treatment: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping Cat), medication (sertraline), their combination, and pill placebo on SRPs. Youth (N = 488, ages 7–17, 50% female, 79% White) with a principal diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or social phobia participated. SRPs were reported by parents and youth. Findings differed by informant and by type of SRP, with evidence that SRPs are associated with age, anxiety severity, externalizing problems, functional impairment, and family burden at pretreatment. Anxiety treatment reduced SRPs; effect sizes were small to medium. Reductions in parent-reported separation-related sleep difficulties were significantly greater in active treatment than in the placebo condition, with the greatest reductions reported by parents of youth whose active treatment was multimodal or included sertraline. Youth whose anxiety treatment involved CBT reported significantly greater decreases in dysregulated sleep (e.g., sleeplessness). Both CBT for anxiety and sertraline appear to be somewhat effective in reducing SRPs, and multimodal treatment may be preferable depending on the symptom presentation. To inform practice, future research should examine a broad range of SRPs, incorporate objective measures of sleep, and evaluate the impact of behavioral strategies that directly target SRPs in youth with anxiety disorders.

abstract={Background: Many patients with anxiety disorders remain symptomatic after receiving evidence-based treatment, yet research on treatment-resistant anxiety is limited. We evaluated effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on outcomes of patients with medication-resistant anxiety disorders using data from the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) trial. Methods: Primary care patients who met study entry criteria (including DSM-IV diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or social anxiety disorder) despite ongoing pharmacotherapy of appropriate type, dose, and duration were classified as medication resistant (n = 227). Logistic regression was used to estimate effects of CALM's CBT program (CALM-CBT; chosen by 104 of 117 medication-resistant patients randomized to CALM) versus usual care (UC; n = 110) on response [≥ 50% reduction of 12-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-12) anxiety and somatic symptom score] and remission (BSI-12 < 6) at 6, 12, and 18 months. Within-group analyses examined outcomes by treatment choice (CBT vs. CBT plus medication management) and CBT dose. Results: Approximately 58% of medication-resistant CALM-CBT patients responded and 46% remitted during the study. Relative to UC, CALM-CBT was associated with greater response at 6 months (AOR = 3.78, 95% CI 2.02-7.07) and 12 months (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.36-4.58) and remission at 6, 12, and 18 months (AORs = 2.44 to 3.18). Patients in CBT plus medication management fared no better than those in CBT only. Some evidence suggested higher CBT dose produced better outcomes. Conclusions: CBT can improve outcomes for patients whose anxiety symptoms are resistant to standard pharmacotherapy. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Emetophobia is an understudied specific phobia, especially during the developmental stage of adolescence. Adult and child literatures suggest that a combined approach of psychopharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions may be an efficacious treatment for emetophobia. Despite evidence supporting the success of this therapeutic approach, research assessing treatment outcomes of adolescent populations with the disorder remains limited. The current study presents a case study of the successful use of combined treatment for emetophobia in an adolescent female. Therapy included psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and exposure therapy in tandem with Sertraline 50 mg. Upon termination of therapeutic services, symptoms of emetophobia were significantly reduced, panic attacks had remitted, and the continued use of psychotropic medication was no longer indicated. Findings in the present case study suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure-based therapy effectively reduced emetophobia symptoms and panic attacks for the patient. The implications for these findings in treating adolescents with emetophobia are discussed. © SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Anxiety disorders belong to the most frequent psychiatric disorders according to epidemiological studies and are associated with a high economic burden. Panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia belong to the most important clinical disorders. The etiology is complex, including genetic, neurobiological as well as psychosocial factors. With regard to treatment, both psychotherapy and medication can be employed according to current treatment guidelines. With regard to psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents the treatment of choice. As for pharmacological treatment, in particular modern antidepressants and pregabalin are recommended. However, several recommendations have to be considered in daily clinical practice. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.},

abstract={Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is frequently comorbid with bipolar disorder (BD), yet frontline pharmacological interventions for SAD are often contraindicated for individuals with BD. We present a case report of a 29-year-old male with Bipolar I Disorder who received cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD, followed by CBT and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for SAD. The patient completed standardized self-report measures of social anxiety and depressive symptoms throughout treatment and at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. The greatest social anxiety symptom improvement occurred during the CBT phase, and the patient experienced small but additional benefit with the incorporation of IPT techniques. Although not a direct target of treatment, the patient's depressive symptoms remained subthreshold throughout treatment. Finally, the patient reported significantly higher quality of life at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, compared with a reference group of BD outpatients. Findings offer preliminary support for the integration of CBT and IPT in treating comorbid SAD among individuals with BD. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed. © SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Social phobia is a common and disabling anxiety disorder (Keller, 2005) with an esti-mated lifetime prevalence of between 3% and 13% (Kessler et al., 2005). The treatment of socialphobia may include medication (Rickels et Rynn, 2002) or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-a generally effective and widely studied form of psychotherapy for social phobia (Bernieret Simard, 2007). However, some patients, either those who have received group or individualpsychotherapy, do not respond or are still symptomatic after CBT (Garakani et al., 2006). Thecurrent paper describes a new method for facilitating change based on psychotherapy augmen-tation through preconscious priming (APAP) (Borgeat et al., 2013) and its use in the treatment ofCaroline, a 34-year-old patient suffering from severe social phobia. Preconscious priming is anapproach that has been in development for several years and shows that perceptions receivedoutside the normal field of consciousness can influence attitudes, emotions, perceptions andthoughts (Borgeat et al., 1989; Kouider et Dehaene, 2007; Van den Bussche et al., 2009; Victoret al., 2010; Daltrozzo et al., 2011). Caroline had been socially anxious since her childhoodwith a high level of anxiety and discomfort in various social situations. Previously, the patienthad shown only a partial response to CBT despite good adherence to treatment. Following thistreatment, the patient completed the APAP process, which consisted of six steps during whichalternative, more functional thoughts and beliefs were formulated, relevant to the idiosyncra-tic difficulties experienced by the patient. Subsequently, these formulations were recorded andmixed with masking relaxing music, following which the patient listened to the recordings ina passive state twice daily for 20 minutes for a period of 8 weeks. The effect of this strategywas evaluated by quantitative and qualitative measures administered before treatment withthe APAP program, at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 24 weeks. In addition, idiosyncratic ratings of dys-functional thoughts, symptoms of anxiety, global functioning and quality of life were assessedat baseline and at 24 weeks. Results showed a significant reduction in dysfunctional thoughtsreported by Caroline. Scores of the Social Interaction Self Statement Test (SISST) (Musa et al.,2004) showed an increase in positive cognitions which were fairly well-maintained throughouttreatment, as well as a decrease in negative cognitions at weeks 8 and 16. However, an increasein SISTT negative cognitions scores was observed at week 24. Scores at the Fear of NegativeEvaluation Scale (FNE) (Musa et al., 2004) decreased at week 8 and 16 to some extent, andincreased at week 24. The observed results of the FNE and the SISST negative at week 24 werelikely due to recent life events related to the re-appearance of her biological mother. Therewas substantial clinical improvement in anxiety symptoms as measured by the Beck AnxietyInventory (Beck et al., 1988) at different points in comparison to baseline. With regards tosymptoms of social phobia, as measured by the Liebowitz Social Phobia Scale (Yao et al., 1999),there was a modest reduction in symptoms with a score of 71 at baseline, to a score of 63 atweek 8, and a score of 59 at week 24. The Quality of Life Systemic Inventory (Duquette et al.,1994) showed significant improvement compared to baseline with a score of 70-representinga good quality of life. In addition, Caroline reported other improvements, including making newfriends and actively pursuing an exhibition of her paintings. In conclusion, the APAP interven-tion had a positive impact on the patient. Results showed that APAP led to positive cognitivechanges and clinically significant improvement in anxiety symptoms and global functioning inour patient, which were maintained long-term. APAP, which is accessed through Internet, couldbe a valuable addition to CBT by facilitating or enhancing cognitive and symptom change. © 2015 Association française de thérapie comportementale et cognitive.},

abstract={A consensus group consisting of 36 experts representing 20 leading German specialist societies and patient self-help organizations developed evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of anxiety disorders in Germany. These were based on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on anxiety disorders (n = 403) and on preexisting German and international guidelines. According to the consensus committee, anxiety disorders should be treated with psychotherapy or pharmacological drugs or a combination of both. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was regarded as the psychological treatment with the highest level of evidence. Psychodynamic therapy (PDT) was recommended for cases in which CBT was not effective or not available or in which PDT was the informed patient’s preferred option. First-line drugs for anxiety disorders include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. After remission, medications should be continued for 6–12 months. When either drug or psychotherapy was not effective, treatment should be switched to the other approach or to a combination of both. For patients non-responsive to standard treatments, alternative strategies are suggested. When developing a treatment plan, efficacy, side effects, costs and the preference of the patient should be considered. A large amount of data available from randomized controlled trials permit the formulation of robust evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of anxiety disorders. The recommendations were not only developed for the special situation in Germany, but may also be helpful for developing treatment plans in other countries. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The use of d-cycloserine (DCS) as a cognitive enhancer to augment exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) represents a promising new translational research direction with the goal to accelerate and optimize treatment response for anxiety disorders. Some studies suggest that DCS may not only augment extinction learning but could also facilitate fear memory reconsolidation. Therefore, the effect of DCS may depend on fear levels reported at the end of exposure sessions. This paper presents the rationale and design for a randomized controlled trial examining the relative efficacy of tailoring DCS administration based on exposure success (i.e. end fear levels) during a 5-session group CBT protocol for social anxiety disorder (n = 156). Specifically, tailored post-session DCS administration will be compared against untailored post-session DCS, untailored pre-session DCS, and pill placebo in terms of reduction in social anxiety symptoms and responder status. In addition, a subset of participants (n = 96) will undergo a fear extinction retention experiment prior to the clinical trial in which they will be randomly assigned to receive either DCS or placebo prior to extinguishing a conditioned fear. The results from this experimental paradigm will clarify the mechanism of the effects of DCS on exposure procedures. This study aims to serve as the first step toward developing an algorithm for the personalized use of DCS during CBT for social anxiety disorder, with the ultimate goal of optimizing treatment outcome for anxiety disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={To our knowledge, no previous meta-analysis has attempted to compare the efficacy of pharmacological, psychological and combined treatments for the three main anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia). Pre-post and treated versus control effect sizes (ES) were calculated for all evaluable randomized-controlled studies (n=234), involving 37 333 patients. Medications were associated with a significantly higher average pre-post ES [Cohen's d=2.02 (1.90-2.15); 28 051 patients] than psychotherapies [1.22 (1.14-1.30); 6992 patients; P<0.0001]. ES were 2.25 for serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (n=23 study arms), 2.15 for benzodiazepines (n=42), 2.09 for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n=62) and 1.83 for tricyclic antidepressants (n=15). ES for psychotherapies were mindfulness therapies, 1.56 (n=4); relaxation, 1.36 (n=17); individual cognitive behavioural/exposure therapy (CBT), 1.30 (n=93); group CBT, 1.22 (n=18); psychodynamic therapy 1.17 (n=5); therapies without face-to-face contact (e.g. Internet therapies), 1.11 (n=34); eye movement desensitization reprocessing, 1.03 (n=3); and interpersonal therapy 0.78 (n=4). The ES was 2.12 (n=16) for CBT/drug combinations. Exercise had an ES of 1.23 (n=3). For control groups, ES were 1.29 for placebo pills (n=111), 0.83 for psychological placebos (n=16) and 0.20 for waitlists (n=50). In direct comparisons with control groups, all investigated drugs, except for citalopram, opipramol and moclobemide, were significantly more effective than placebo. Individual CBT was more effective than waiting list, psychological placebo and pill placebo. When looking at the average pre-post ES, medications were more effective than psychotherapies. Pre-post ES for psychotherapies did not differ from pill placebos; this finding cannot be explained by heterogeneity, publication bias or allegiance effects. However, the decision on whether to choose psychotherapy, medications or a combination of the two should be left to the patient as drugs may have side effects, interactions and contraindications. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={Background: A significant number of patients who suffer with anxiety and related disorders (that is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder (SAnD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD), specific phobia (SPh) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) fail to respond optimally to first-line treatment with medication or cognitive and behavioural therapies. The addition of d-cycloserine (DCS) to cognitive and behavioural therapies may improve treatment response by impacting the glutamatergic system. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of adding DCS to cognitive and behavioural therapies by synthesising data from relevant randomised controlled trials and following the guidelines recommended by Cochrane. Objectives: To assess the effect of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared to placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders. Additionally, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of DCS across different anxiety and related disorders. Search methods: This review fully incorporates studies identified from a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 12 March 2015. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date), the World Health Organizations trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of RCTs were also checked. No restrictions were placed on language, setting, date or publication status. Selection criteria: All RCTs of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies versus placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for anxiety and related disorders were included. Data collection and analysis: Two authors (RO and TA) independently assessed RCTs for eligibility and inclusion, extracted outcomes and risk of bias data and entered these into a customised extraction form. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. In addition, data entry and analysis were performed by two review authors (KSW and HB). Main results: Twenty-one published RCTs, with 788 participants in outpatient settings, were included in the review. Sixteen studies had an age range of 18 to 75 years, while four investigated paediatric populations aged 8 to 17 years and one included children, adolescents and adults. The 21 RCTs investigated OCD (number of RCTs (N) = 6), PTSD (N = 5), SAnD (N = 5), SPh (N = 3) and PD (N = 2). Most information from the studies was rated as having either low risk or unclear risk of bias. There was no evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for the treatment of anxiety and related disorders in adults at the endpoint (treatment responders, N = 9, risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.34; number of participants (n) = 449; low quality evidence) and between 1 and 12 months follow-up (N = 7, RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31; n = 383). DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies was not superior to placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for children and adolescents, both at the endpoint (N = 4, RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; n = 121; low quality evidence) and between 3 and 12 months follow-up (N = 3, RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.09; n = 91). There was no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability for DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in adults (N = 16, RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.25; n = 740), nor in children and adolescents (N = 4, RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.17 to 4.69; n = 131). These conclusions were based on moderate quality evidence for adults, and very low quality evidence for children and adolescents. Although the observed difference was small, it is noteworthy that there was a high efficacy of exposure-based therapies alone in the included trials. Due to the limited number of studies, subgroup analysis of moderating factors for clinical and methodological effect could not take place. Authors' conclusions: This review found no evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for treating anxiety and related disorders in children, adolescents and adults. These findings are based on low quality evidence from heterogenous studies with small sample sizes and incomplete data for clinical response, which precludes us from drawing conclusions on the use of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies at this stage. Given there is some promising preliminary data from individual studies, further research is necessary to assess DCS compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies, and determine mechanisms of action as well as magnitude of effect in anxiety and related disorders. © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.},

abstract={Objective To evaluate the frequency of adverse events (AEs) across 4 treatment conditions in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), and to compare the frequency of AEs between children and adolescents. Method Participants ages 7 to 17 years (mean = 10.7 years) meeting the DSM-IV criteria for 1 or more of the following disorders: separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia were randomized (2:2:2:1) to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT, n = 139), sertraline (SRT, n = 133), a combination of both (COMB, n = 140), or pill placebo (PBO, n = 76). Data on AEs were collected via a standardized inquiry method plus a self-report Physical Symptom Checklist (PSC). Results There were no differences between the double-blinded conditions (SRT versus PBO) for total physical and psychiatric AEs or any individual physical or psychiatric AEs. The rates of total physical AEs were greater in the SRT-alone treatment condition when compared to CBT (p <.01) and COMB (p <.01). Moreover, those who received SRT alone reported higher rates of several physical AEs when compared to COMB and CBT. The rate of total psychiatric AEs was higher in children (≤12 years) across all arms (31.7% versus 23.1%, p <.05). Total PSC scores decreased over time, with no significant differences between treatment groups. Conclusion The results support the tolerability/safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment for anxiety disorders even after adjusting for the number of reporting opportunities, leading to no differences in overall rates of AEs. Few differences occurred on specific items. Additional monitoring of psychiatric AEs is recommended in children (≤12 years).

abstract={Background: A previous Cochrane review (James 2005) showed that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus non-CBT active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and the combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long-term effects of CBT. Objectives: To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait-list controls; (b) active non-CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, bibliotherapy and treatment as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the combination of medication and CBT versus placebo; and (2) the long-term effects of CBT. Search methods: Searches for this review included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases The Cochrane Library (1970 to July 2012), EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and PsycINFO (1970 to July 2012). Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were reviewed. All participants must have met the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for an anxiety diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and elective mutism. Data collection and analysis: The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects model, with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was used. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child's anxiety symptoms were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Main results: Forty-one studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR of 7.85 (95% CI 5.31 to 11.60, Z = 10.26, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.04, I2 = 33%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 6.0 (95% CI 7.5 to 4.6). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow-up studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis are not statistically significant. Authors' conclusions: Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or TAU or medication at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive. © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.},

abstract={Background: The practicing of protocols based on behavioral cognitive therapy (CBT) have been frequently used in the last decades and adapted to better manage the necessities of patients and providers.
Objectives; The goal is to build a treatment that is evidence-based - for that reason the unified protocol for multiple emotional disorders (transdiagnostics) have been utilized to simplify treatment - without losing scientific traits. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the unified protocol in groups of patients with depression and anxiety disorders.
Materials and methods: In a pool of 48 subjects, divided in two groups, one was submitted to 12 intervention sessions of the unified protocol while the other was solely given medication. MINI, BAI and BDI were the instruments used at the beginning and at the end of treatment.
Results: The results were highly significant (p<0.001) in as much as with the improvement of anxiety and depressive disorders as it was in the group which was treated with the unified protocol compared with the group which was only given medication.
Limitations: Limitations of this study were the number of sample participants and the non-randomization of subjects in both groups.
Conclusion: Group therapy has not been largely implemented though it is deemed very useful for treatments when the unified protocol is used in transdiagnostic patients. Not only does it allow for emotional stabilizing and socialization but it also enables subjects with an altruistic feeling amongst themselves. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this investigation was to evaluate how parental anxiety predicted change in pediatric anxiety symptoms across four different interventions: cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication (sertraline; SRT), their combination (COMB), and pill placebo. Participants were 488 youths (ages 7–17) with separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia and their primary caregivers. Latent growth curve modeling assessed how pre-treatment parental trait anxiety symptoms predicted trajectories of youth anxiety symptom change across 12 weeks of treatment at four time points. Interactions between parental anxiety and treatment condition were tested. Parental anxiety was not associated with youth’s pre-treatment anxiety symptom severity. Controlling for parental trait anxiety, youth depressive symptoms, and youth age, youths who received COMB benefitted most. Counter to expectations, parental anxiety influenced youth anxiety symptom trajectory only within the SRT condition, whereas parental anxiety was not significantly associated with youth anxiety trajectories in the other treatment conditions. Specifically, within the SRT condition, higher levels of parental anxiety predicted a faster and greater reduction in youth anxiety over the acute treatment period compared to youths in the SRT condition whose parents had lower anxiety levels. While all active treatments produced favorable outcomes, results provide insight regarding the treatment-specific influence of parental anxiety on the time course of symptom change. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to establish the efficacy of CBT or short psychodynamic psychotherapy on the sample of non-selected and mostly medication-resistant patients with anxiety disorders (panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, adjustment disorders, other anxiety disorders) and to search for predictors of therapeutic response in such a group. METHOD: The treatment was carried out under usual conditions at the department for anxiety disorders. Short psychodynamic psychotherapy or systematic cognitive behavioural therapy was tailored according the needs of each patient. Pharmacology treatment remained mainly unchanged during the trial period. We used the following outcome measures in the study: the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness scale (CGI), Dissociative Experience Scale (DES), Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ-20), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The primary outcome measures were clinical response defined as 30% decrease in BAI and remission defined as a 1 or 2 points in CGI at the end of therapy. RESULTS: 191 patients (137 female) were included in the study and 15 dropped out. Altogether 175 patients completed at least 5 of 6 weeks of intensive psychotherapy program. Patients of all diagnostic groups showed significant improvement in CGI, BAI, BDI. At the end of the treatment, 50.3% decreased 30% or more in BAI and 55.7% reached 1 or 2 points in CGI. The main characteristics present at the beginning of the trial increasing probability of achieving response or remission during the treatment were BAI score lower than 25, BDI score less than 20, no comorbidity with personality disorder, no comorbid depression, no being divorced or widowed. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic efficacy of the intensive psychotherapeutics programs for anxiety disorders was predicted with level of anxiety and depression, comorbidity with depression and personality disorders and marital status. © 2015 Act Nerv Super Rediviva.},

abstract={Anxiety disorders are prevalent and represent an important focus of treatment within the field of psychiatry as well as within medicine more broadly. First-line pharmacotherapy treatment for anxiety disorders is serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients who do not responsd to an initial first-line treatment, clinicians should ensure that there has been adequate exposure to the medication by assessing compliance and optimizing the prescribed dose. Non-response to a treatment trial should also prompt a re-evaluation of the diagnosis and a search for occult psychiatric, substance, or general medical disorders. Laboratory tests and other components of a diagnostic work-up should be considered if they have not already been completed. Following confirmation of the diagnosis, the clinician should consider a switch to an agent from a different class, for example a tricyclic antidepressant or monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Combination treatments with an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine, second-generation antipsychotic, anticonvulsant, β-blocker, or other medication may be considered but data is limited. Psychotherapy is an important treatment component for anxiety disorders and should be implemented whenever feasible. Variants of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular are effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, and data suggest that the combination for CBT plus medication may be particularly beneficial for patients. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), while sharing many clinical features with anxiety disorders, represents its own unique clinical challenge and has been removed from the category of anxiety disorders in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). SSRIs are first-line therapy for OCD and higher doses are often required compared with anxiety disorders or major depressive disorder. Exposure and response prevention may be a particularly helpful form of psychotherapy for this patient population. For severe, intractable OCD, deep brain stimulation may be an appropriate therapeutic option. © 2014, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) commonly co-occur in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), yet whether these comorbidities influence the outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD is unclear. Methods The present study examined the degree to which individuals with SAD and comorbid MDD (SAD+MDD; n=76), comorbid BD (SAD+BD; n=19), a comorbid anxiety disorder (SAD+ANX; n=27), or no comorbid diagnoses (SAD+NCO; n=41) benefitted from CBT for SAD. Individuals were screened using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and then completed the Social Phobia Inventory and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales before and after 12-weeks of group CBT for SAD. Results At pretreatment the SAD+MDD and SAD+BD groups reported higher social anxiety symptoms than the SAD+ANX and SAD+NCO groups. All groups reported large and significant improvement in social anxiety with CBT. However, at posttreatment the SAD+MDD and SAD+BD groups continued to have higher social anxiety symptoms than the SAD+NCO group, and the SAD+ANX group did not differ in social anxiety symptoms from any group. The sample also showed small and statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms with CBT for SAD. Limitations Information about medication was not collected in the present study, and we did not assess the long-term effects of CBT. Conclusion Our results suggest that CBT for SAD is an effective treatment even in the presence of comorbid mood disorders in the short-term, although extending the course of treatment may be helpful for this population and should be investigated in future research. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Anxiety disorders are commonly treated with antidepressants and psychological treatments. Some patients may prefer alternative approaches such as exercise. Objective: To investigate the treatment effects of exercise compared with other treatments for anxiety disorders. Data sources: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise interventions for anxiety disorders were identified by searching six online databases (July 2011). A number of journals were also hand searched. Main results: Eight RCTs were included. For panic disorder: exercise appears to reduce anxiety symptoms but it is less effective than antidepressant medication (1 RCT); exercise combined with antidepressant medication improves the Clinical Global Impression outcomes (1 RCT, p<0.05); exercise combined with occupational therapy and lifestyle changes reduces Beck Anxiety Inventory outcomes (1 RCT, p=0.0002). For social phobias, added benefits of exercise when combined with group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) were shown (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise groups (1 RCT, p>0.1) with both seeming to reduce anxiety symptoms (1 RCT, p<0.001). It remains unclear as to which type of exercise; moderate to hard or very light to light, is more effective in anxiety reduction (2 RCTs). Conclusions: Exercise seems to be effective as an adjunctive treatment for anxiety disorders but it is less effective compared with antidepressant treatment. Both aerobic and non-aerobic exercise seems to reduce anxiety symptoms. Social phobics may benefit from exercise when combined with group CBT. Further wellconducted RCTs are needed.},

abstract={Late life anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric conditions among older adults and they often present at a sub-threshold level. Specific phobias (SP) are particularly frequent and fear of falling is increasingly being recognized as a class of phobias typically seen in older adults. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), although recognized as a chronic disorder with early onset, has been found to have an onset late in life as well. Social phobia (SoP) has been found to not necessarily have a chronic course in this population. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) manifests in older adults often as an exacerbation of symptoms from a trauma earlier in life. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) augmented with learning and memory aids, and a combination of CBT and medication, has had good outcomes in the management of anxiety disorders in older adults. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The prevalence rate was found to increase from 2% to 8.7% when the sub threshold cases were included and subjects in both groups had similar impairments of more chronic physical health problems, more comorbid depressive disorders and a higher use of benzodiazepines compared to respondents with no symptoms. The results highlight the high prevalence of sub threshold phobias in older adults and the fact that they need help just as much as those with the full phobias; Rhebergen, D., Batelaan, N.M., De Graaf, R., Nolen, W.A., Spijker, J., Beekman, A.T., The 7-year course of depression and anxiety in the general population (2011) Acta Psychiatr Scand, 123, pp. 297-306. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BC3M3ktVKmuw%3D%3D 21294714; Grenier, S., Préville, M., Boyer, R., The impact of DSM-IV symptom and clinical significance criteria on the prevalence estimates of subthreshold and threshold anxiety in the older adult population (2011) Am J Geriatr Psychiatry, 19, pp. 316-326. , 3682986 21427640; Mohlman, J., Bryant, C., Lenze, E.J., Stanley, M.A., Gum, A., Flint, A., Improving recognition of late life anxiety disorders in diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition: Observations and recommendations of the advisory committee to the lifespan disorders work group (2012) Int J Geriatr Psychiatry, 27 (6), pp. 549-556. , 4048716 21773996 10.1002/gps.2752 This paper signals the growing recognition of the significance of anxiety disorders in older adults.

abstract={With a lifetime prevalence of 13% social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is a common and serious condition that should not be played down because of the burden associated with the disorder, an increased suicide rate and the frequent comorbidity with substance abuse disorders. Social phobia is characterized by the excessive and unrealistic fear of being scrutinized or criticized by others. The disorder often begins in adolescence. Symptoms of social phobia can be effectively treated with evidence-based treatment, including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and psychopharmacological medications. In the present paper, treatment recommendations are given, which are based on a systematic review of all available randomized trials for the treatment of social phobia. Among psychological therapies, variants of CBT have been proven to be effective in controlled studies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine are among the drugs of first choice. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={There is some evidence indicating that psychotropic medications might lead to health-related quality of life (QOL) improvements among children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The aim of this systematic review is to assess evidence regarding whether antidepressant treatment improves QOL among children and adolescents with depressive or anxiety disorders. A comprehensive search resulted in 5 clinical trials to be included in this review: 4 trials with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 1 trial with social anxiety disorder (SAD). In one MDD trial, fluoxetine combined with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) significantly improved QOL compared to fluoxetine or CBT alone (effect sizes were 0.53 and 0.69, respectively). In 2 combined trials, sertraline alone significantly improved QOL among adolescents with MDD (effect size was 0.29), but not among children with MDD. Essentially, it was observed that antidepressants in these trials had minor positive effects on QOL improvement, which were lower than their potential to improve depressive symptoms. Although fluoxetine with CBT or sertraline monotherapy were shown to have some potential to improve QOL, this systematic review found inconclusive evidence that antidepressant treatments improve QOL among children and adolescents with depressive or anxiety disorders. More research is required, considering that QOL is currently under-evaluated in clinical trials with antidepressants among children and adolescents and available trials have limited methodological quality when reporting QOL data. © Cambridge University Press 2013.},

abstract={Objective: In the current study, we compared measures of treatment outcome and engagement for Latino and non-Latino White patients receiving a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program delivered in primary care. Method: Participants were 18-65 years old and recruited from 17 clinics at 4 different sites to participate in a randomized controlled trial for anxiety disorders, which compared the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention (consisting of CBT, medication, or both) with usual care. Of those participants who were randomized to the intervention arm and selected CBT (either alone or in combination with medication), 85 were Latino and 251 were non-Latino White; the majority of the Latino participants received the CBT intervention in English (n = 77). Blinded assessments of clinical improvement and functioning were administered at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Measures of engagement, including attendance, homework adherence, understanding of CBT principles, and commitment to treatment, were assessed weekly during the CBT intervention. Results: Findings from propensity-weighted linear and logistic regression models revealed no statistically significant differences between Latinos and non-Latino Whites on symptom measures of clinical improvement and functioning at almost all time points. There were significant differences on 2 of 7 engagement outcomes, namely, number of sessions attended and patients' understanding of CBT principles. Conclusions: These findings suggest that CBT can be an effective treatment approach for Latinos who are primarily English speaking and likely more acculturated, although continued attention should be directed toward engaging Latinos in such interventions. © 2014 American Psychological Association.},

Method: Six classes of predictor and moderator variables (22 variables) were identified from the literature and examined using continuous (Pediatric Anxiety Ratings Scale; PARS) and categorical (Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement; CGI-I) outcome measures. Results: Three baseline variables predicted better outcomes (independent of treatment condition) on the PARS, including low anxiety severity (as measured by parents and independent evaluators) and caregiver strain. No baseline variables were found to predict Week 12 responder status (CGI-I). Participantsâ principal diagnosis moderated treatment outcomes but only on the PARS. No baseline variables were found to moderate treatment outcomes on Week 12 responder status (CGI-I). Discussion: Overall, anxious children responded favorably to CAMS treatments. However, having more severe and impairing anxiety, greater caregiver strain, and a principal diagnosis of social phobia were associated with less favorable outcomes. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). © 2014 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Background To examine (1) changes in parent (global psychological distress, trait anxiety) and family (dysfunction, burden) functioning following 12 weeks of child-focused anxiety treatment, and (2) whether changes in these parent and family factors were associated with child's treatment condition and response. Methods Participants were 488 youth ages 7-17 years (50% female; mean age 10.7 years) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for social phobia, separation anxiety, and/or generalized anxiety disorder, and their parents. Youth were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of "Coping Cat" individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication management with sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or medication management with pill placebo (PBO) within the multisite Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). At pre-and posttreatment, parents completed measures of trait anxiety, psychological distress, family functioning, and burden of child illness; children completed a measure of family functioning. Blinded independent evaluators rated child's response to treatment using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale at posttreatment. Results Analyses of covariance revealed that parental psychological distress and trait anxiety, and parent-reported family dysfunction improved only for parents of children who were rated as treatment responders, and these changes were unrelated to treatment condition. Family burden and child-reported family dysfunction improved significantly from pre-to posttreatment regardless of treatment condition or response. Conclusions Findings suggest that child-focused anxiety treatments, regardless of intervention condition, can result in improvements in nontargeted parent symptoms and family functioning particularly when children respond successfully to the treatment. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={School Refusal (SR) is a serious problem that will interfere with daily life and future of children and adolescents. To date, two ways including psychotherapy and medication are taken into consideration to treat SR. It has been reported that Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) might be effective for SR. SR frequently combines with depression and anxiety and we therefore assume that fluoxetine combined with CBT may increase the efficiency of CBT for SR. Our study investigated the efficacy of CBT combined fluoxetine treatment and CBT alone for School Refusal (SR). A total of 75 patients with SR were randomized into two groups: CBT group (n = 36) and CBT plus Fluoxetine group (n = 39). Treatment was done for 12 weeks. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale, Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S) and percentage of school attendance were used for evaluation before and after treatment. The therapeutic efficacy was compared between two groups. After 12 weeks, in the CBT group, the SAS score, SDS score and CGI-S score were significantly decreased (p<0.01) and the percentage of school attendance was 72.2%; in the CBT plus Fluoxetine group, the SAS score, SDS score and CGI-S score were significantly decreased (p<0.01) and the percentage of school attendance was 82.1%. There were no significant differences in the SAS score, SDS score, CGI-S score and the percentage of school attendance after 12-week treatment between two groups (p<0.01). Our results demonstrated that the CBT combined Fluoxetine treatment has comparable therapeutic efficacy to CBT alone for SR, but was not superior to CBT alone. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Objective: The authors examined whether D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glutamatergicN- methyl-D-aspartate receptor, augments and accelerates a full course of comprehensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in adults with generalized social anxiety disorder. Method: This was a multisite randomized placebo-controlled efficacy study with 169 medication-free adults with generalized social anxiety disorder, of whom 144 completed the 12-week treatment and 131 completed the three follow-up assessments. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg of D-cycloserine or placebo 1 hour before each of five exposure sessions that were part of a 12-session cognitivebehavioral group treatment. Response and remission status was determined at baseline, throughout treatment, at end of treatment, and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments by assessors who were blind to treatment condition. Results: D-Cycloserine-augmented and placebo-augmented CBT were associated with similar completion rates (87% and 82%), response rates (79.3% and 73.3%), and remission rates (34.5% and 24.4%) at the posttreatment assessment; response and remission rates were largely maintained at the follow-up assessments. Although D-cycloserine was associated with a 24%-33% faster rate of improvement in symptom severity and remission rates relative to placebo during the treatment phase, the groups did not differ in response and remission rates. Conclusions: D-Cycloserine did not augment a full course of comprehensive CBT for social anxiety disorder.},

abstract={Background: A previous Cochrane review (James 2005) showed that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus non-CBT active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and the combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long-term effects of CBT. Objectives: To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait-list controls; (b) active non-CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, bibliotherapy and treatment as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the combination of medication and CBT versus placebo; and (2) the long-term effects of CBT. Search methods: Searches for this review included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases The Cochrane Library (1970 to July 2012), EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and PsycINFO (1970 to July 2012). Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were reviewed. All participants must have met the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for an anxiety diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and elective mutism. Data collection and analysis: The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects model, with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was used. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each childs anxiety symptoms were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Main results: Forty-one studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR of 0.13 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.19, Z = 10.26, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.04, I2 = 33%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 6.0 (95% CI 7.5 to 4.6). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow-up studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis are not statistically significant. Authors' conclusions: Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or TAU or medication at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive. © 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.},

abstract={Modifying dysfunctional emotion regulation is an important goal in psychological treatments for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Antecedent-focused strategies learned in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), such as cognitive reappraisal, have proven more effective in reducing social anxiety than response-focused strategies, such as expressive suppression. Still, not all patients with SAD respond well to CBT. Medications and physiological factors may also influence the clinical response. The purpose of the present study was to examine the role that these factors play in determining treatment response following CBT for SAD. Using multilevel modeling, we examined associations across four separate laboratory visits between change in self-reported anxiety and indices of reappraisal, suppression, medication status, and resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a proxy measure of self-regulatory capacity, in 23 socially anxious adults during a 12-week program of CBT. Most participants were ultimately classified as responders to CBT (n=15), but in some, anxiety levels remained unchanged (n=8). Medication use explained substantial variance related to individual differences in anxiety among participants. When modeled separately, reappraisal, suppression, and RSA each accounted for significant variance related to anxiety. However, the best-fitting model included reappraisal and RSA. Moreover, RSA reactivity (change in RSA levels over time) was more important for predicting anxiety reduction than were baseline levels of RSA. These findings suggest that reappraisal and parasympathetic responsiveness may be important in reducing anxiety in adults with SAD who respond well to CBT. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This analog study investigated treatment acceptability and preference as a function of safety behavior use (judicious vs. discouraged) and treatment rationale (cognitive vs. extinction). Thirty-two clinically anxious participants and 437 undergraduate students provided ratings of acceptability and adherence, as well as preference ranks for four written vignettes describing a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for fear or anxiety. Treatment descriptions promoting judicious safety behavior use received significantly higher acceptability and adherence ratings compared to those discouraging its use. Descriptions that presented a cognitively based rationale, compared to an extinction-based rationale, were also rated as both significantly more acceptable and easier to adhere to. The highest preference rank was for treatment that included judicious safety behavior use, conveyed via a cognitive rationale. A similar pattern of results was observed in both participant groups. These findings suggest that the judicious incorporation of safety behavior into CBT has the potential to reduce treatment refusal and dropout. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for cognitive-behavioral and exposure-based treatments. © 2013 Springer Publishing Company.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of the current study was to identify individual characteristics that (a) predict symptom improvement with group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD; i.e., prognostic variables) or (b) moderate the effects of d-cycloserine (DCS) versus placebo augmentation of CBT for SAD (i.e., prescriptive variables). Method: Adults with SAD (N = 169) provided Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores in a trial evaluating DCS augmentation of group CBT. Rate of symptom improvement during therapy and posttreatment symptom severity were evaluated using multilevel modeling. As predictors of these 2 parameters, we selected the range of variables assessed at baseline (demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, personality traits). Using step-wise analyses, we first identified prognostic and prescriptive variables within each of these domains and then entered these significant predictors simultaneously in 1 final model. Results: African American ethnicity and cohabitation status were associated with greater overall rates of improvement during therapy and lower posttreatment severity. Higher initial severity was associated with a greater improvement during therapy but also higher posttreatment severity (the greater improvement was not enough to overcome the initial higher severity). DCS augmentation was evident only among individuals low in conscientiousness and high in agreeableness. Conclusions: African American ethnicity, cohabitation status, and initial severity are prognostic of favorable CBT outcomes in SAD. DCS augmentation appears particularly useful for patients low in conscientiousness and high in agreeableness. These findings can guide clinicians in making decisions about treatment strategies and can help direct research on the mechanisms of these treatments. © 2013 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={This article provides a brief review of the current available data concerning present treatment and potential new treatment advances for pediatric anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Disorder-specific treatment methods and innovations, particularly computer-assisted methods of delivery for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) will be reviewed. Additionally, the paper will discuss novel psychopharmacological compounds (e.g., d-cycloserine, riluzole, memantine, and anticonvulsant medications). Available evidence for the efficacy of novel medication strategies in adult studies and implications for their use in pediatrics will be discussed. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Objective: Some studies report that initial anxiety is associated with equivocal or negative effects in depression treatment. In contrast, at least 4 studies of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) report that anxiety predicts greater or more rapid change in depression. Further exploration is needed to clarify the relationship between initial anxiety and depression change. Questions include the relationship between anxiety and patterns of change and time to relapse, as well as the specificity effects to CBT. Method: The study assessed the relation of Beck Anxiety Inventory anxiety scores to early rapid change and overall change in Beck Depression Inventory-II depression scores during acute depression treatment. Participants were 178 individuals enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of CBT versus antidepressant medications (ADMs) for moderate to severe depression. They were 58% female and 83% Caucasian, with an average age of 40 (SD = 11.5). Thirty-four percent (34%) were married or cohabitating. Hierarchical linear models, including quadratic growth parameters, were used to model change. The relation of anxiety to the probability of posttreatment relapse was also examined. Results: Findings indicate that higher levels of anxiety predict early rapid change, but not overall change, in both CBT and ADM. However, patients with higher levels of intake anxiety evidenced increased risk for relapse after CBT. Conclusions: Early rapid change predicted by anxiety occurs across different treatment conditions, but this early rapid response is not indicative of positive overall outcome in all cases. These findings might indicate that anxiety predicts a response to nonspecific "common factors" of treatment. © 2013 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Objective: The evidence for the efficacy of d-cycloserine (DCS) for augmenting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders has been mixed. Guided by preclinical research and initial findings from a small-scale study involving humans, we tested the hypothesis that DCS enhancement of exposure therapy would be specific to successful exposure sessions. Method: Medication-free adults with generalized social anxiety disorder (N=145) received 50mg of DCS or placebo 1h before each of 5 exposure sessions that were part of a standardized 12-session group CBT protocol. Participants provided fear ratings at the beginning and just before the end of exposure exercises. Independent raters, blind to group assignment, administered the clinical global impression improvement and severity scales at each session and at posttreatment. Results: Mixed-effects analyses revealed that, among patients who reported low fear at the end of an exposure session, those who had received DCS evidenced significantly greater clinical improvement at the next session, relative to those who had received placebo. In contrast, when exposure end fear was high, patients receiving DCS exhibited less clinical improvement at the following session than patients receiving placebo. Similarly, patients who had received DCS evidenced lower clinical severity at posttreatment, relative to patients who had received placebo, only when their average end fear for medication-augmented sessions had been in the low to moderate range. Finally, these moderating effects of exposure success as indexed by end fear were not better accounted for by within-session extinction. Conclusions: The efficacy of DCS for augmenting exposure-based CBT depends on the success of exposure sessions. These findings may help guide the development of an algorithm for the effective use of DCS for augmenting exposure-based CBT.

abstract={The goal of this cross-sectional study was to identify the rates and correlates of treatment refusal and/or dropout in a treatment-seeking sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Specifically, we investigated the relationships between treatment adherence and different OCD dimensions, intelligence, and insight into OCD. The study involved 60 patients with OCD who were being treated in a specialized university OCD clinic. The patients' adherence to standard treatment was assessed with the Treatment Adherence Survey-Patient Version. Patients were also evaluated with the following instruments: the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0, the Dimensional Yale-Brown ObsessiveCompulsive Scale-short version, the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Sheehan Disability Scale, and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. The patients with OCD who refused to undertake CBT (46%) displayed greater rates of obsessions with aggressive/violent content. Among patients who started CBT (n=32), 51% withdrew before completing therapy. Patients who refused medication for OCD (52%) displayed greater severity of OCD (particularly hoarding), less insight into symptoms, and greater disability. Of the patients with OCD who were given drug therapy (n=58), 61% reported having taken their medication less frequently and/or at a smaller dose than prescribed or discontinuing the use of medication altogether. Treatment nonadherence is common among patients with OCD. This study found that aggressive/violent obsessions were associated with nonadherence to CBT, while greater severity of OCD (particularly hoarding) and poorer insight were associated with poorer adherence to drug therapy. Future research is needed to clarify whether these OCD phenotypes predict or are the consequence of treatment nonadherence. Copyright © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Inc.},

abstract={Context: Current behavioral measures poorly predict treatment outcome in social anxiety disorder (SAD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine neuroimaging- based treatment prediction in SAD. Objective: To measure brain activation in patients with SAD as a biomarker to predict subsequent response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Design: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected prior to CBT intervention. Changes in clinical status were regressed on brain responses and tested for selectivity for social stimuli. Setting: Patients were treated with protocol-based CBT at anxiety disorder programs at Boston University or Massachusetts General Hospital and underwent neuroimaging data collection at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Patients : Thirty-nine medication-free patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for the generalized subtype of SAD. Interventions: Brain responses to angry vs neutral faces or emotional vs neutral scenes were examined with fMRI prior to initiation of CBT. Main Outcome Measures: Whole-brain regression analyses with differential fMRI responses for angry vs neutral faces and changes in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale score as the treatment outcome measure. Results : Pretreatment responses significantly predicted subsequent treatment outcome of patients selectively for social stimuli and particularly in regions of higher-order visual cortex. Combining the brain measures with information on clinical severity accounted for more than 40% of the variance in treatment response and substantially exceeded predictions based on clinical measures at baseline. Prediction success was unaffected by testing for potential confounding factors such as depression severity at baseline. Conclusions: The results suggest that brain imaging can provide biomarkers that substantially improve predictions for the success of cognitive behavioral interventions and more generally suggest that such biomarkers may offer evidence-based, personalized medicine approaches for optimally selecting among treatment options for a patient. ©2013 American Medical Association.

abstract={Objective: To determine optimal Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) percent reduction and raw score cut-offs for predicting treatment response and remission among children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Method: Data were from a subset of youth (N = 438; 7-17 years of age) who participated in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), a multi-site, randomized controlled trial that examined the relative efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping Cat), medication (sertraline [SRT]), their combination, and pill placebo for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. The clinician-rated PARS was administered pre- and posttreatment (delivered over 12 weeks). Quality receiver operating characteristic methods assessed the performance of various PARS percent reductions and absolute cut-off scores in predicting treatment response and remission, as determined by posttreatment ratings on the Clinical Global Impression scales and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV. Corresponding change in impairment was evaluated using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale. Results: Reductions of 35% and 50% on the six-item PARS optimally predicted treatment response and remission, respectively. Post-treatment PARS raw scores of 8 to 10 optimally predicted remission. Anxiety improved as a function of PARS-defined treatment response and remission. Conclusions: Results serve as guidelines for operationalizing treatment response and remission in future research and in making cross-study comparisons. These guidelines can facilitate translation of research findings into clinical practice. © 2013 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.},

abstract={Background: The increasing use of new technologies and virtual communication involving personal computers (PCs), tablets and mobile phones are causing changes in individuals' daily habits and behavior. We report the case of an individual with social phobia who developed a dependency on communication through virtual environments (i.e.; nomophobia), and used a PC as a form of relating to the outside world to reduce stress and to avoid direct social relations. Nomophobia refers to the discomfort or anxiety caused by the non-availability of a mobile phone, PC or any another virtual communication device. Social phobia is described as an anxiety disorder of chronic evolution. Objective: To study nomophobia as a manifest behavior that might serve as an indication of a possible anxiety disorder. Methodology: The treatment consisted of the use of medication, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and the application of evaluation tools (interviews, scales, inventories and questionnaires). Results: The individual responded satisfactorily to medication and CBT treatment, which reduced his time using the PC and increased his exposure to real-life situations. Conclusion: Nomophobic behavior produces changes in daily habits and can reveal other aspects to be investigated, such as the presence of comorbid mental disorders. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background Improving the quality of mental health care requires integrating successful research interventions into 'real-world' practice settings. Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) is a treatment-delivery model for anxiety disorders encountered in primary care. CALM offers cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medication, or both; non-expert care managers assisting primary care clinicians with adherence promotion and medication optimization; computer-assisted CBT delivery; and outcome monitoring. This study describes incremental benefits, costs and net benefits of CALM versus usual care (UC). Method The CALM randomized, controlled effectiveness trial was conducted in 17 primary care clinics in four US cities from 2006 to 2009. Of 1062 eligible patients, 1004 English-or Spanish-speaking patients aged 18-75 years with panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with or without major depression were randomized. Anxiety-free days (AFDs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and expenditures for out-patient visits, emergency room (ER) visits, in-patient stays and psychiatric medications were estimated based on blinded telephone assessments at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. Results Over 18 months, CALM participants, on average, experienced 57.1 more AFDs [95% confidence interval (CI) 31-83] and $245 additional medical expenses (95% CI $-733 to $1223). The mean incremental net benefit (INB) of CALM versus UC was positive when an AFD was valued ≥$4. For QALYs based on the Short-Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12) and the EuroQol EQ-5D, the mean INB was positive at ≥$5000. Conclusions Compared with UC, CALM provides significant benefits with modest increases in health-care expenditures. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is one of the most common anxiety disorders and has been shown to be effectively treated using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Recently, a manualized CBT treatment for SAD has been developed, with research demonstrating superior treatment outcomes with CBT relative to alternatives (e.g., psychotropic medication). The current case study of Henry, a 26-year-old Caucasian male with SAD, implemented this manualized CBT for SAD. Treatment consisted of 15 individual sessions, with follow-ups occurring 2 and 8 months post treatment. Henry showed marked reductions in SAD symptoms throughout the course of treatment, resulting in complete remission of SAD at the end of formal treatment. His SAD continued to be in remission at the 2-month and 8-month follow-up sessions. This case study demonstrates the usefulness of a manualized, individual CBT treatment for SAD. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={Introduction: Anxiety disorders represent one of the most prevalent forms of psychopathology among children and adolescents. As these problems tend to persist and have a negative impact on young people's development, there is a need for evidence-based interventions. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is at present the treatment of first choice, but pharmacotherapy and in particular antidepressant medication may be a viable alternative or adjunct to CBT. Areas covered: This paper provides a detailed overview of controlled treatment outcome studies on the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotoninnoradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Further, a discussion is provided on how clinically anxious youths should be preferably treated, with special focus on the position of pharmacotherapy in the treatment process. Expert opinion: The short-term efficacy of antidepressants in anxious youths is good, and this is particularly true for SSRIs. Therefore, this type of medication should be viewed as a viable treatment option, in particular for youths with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or other severe and pervasive anxiety disorders. More research is needed on the long-term effects, the consequences of prolonged use of this type of medication for children's developing brains and the efficacy of an intervention in which CBT and SSRIs are combined.},

abstract={Background: Most patients with anxiety disorders receive their care from primary care practitioners (PCPs). The purpose of this study was to evaluate quality of and patient satisfaction with primary health care for anxiety disorders. Method: A survey was performed among 1,004 outpatients with anxiety disorders (diagnosed according to DSM-IV) referred by their PCPs from 17 primary care clinical settings (3 of which were university-affiliated) in 4 regions of the United States for participation in the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) study, a therapeutic trial. Participating research institutions were the University of Washington at Seattle, the University of California at San Diego and Los Angeles, and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at Little Rock. Enrollment took place between June 2006 and April 2008. Patients were contacted by telephone after enrollment to provide information about previous care received (during the 6 months prior to referral) and satisfaction with that care. Quality-of-care indicators were self-reported type, dose, and duration of antianxiety medication treatment and self-reported psychotherapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) elements. Results: A total of 576 patients (57.4%) had received an appropriate antianxiety medication in the previous 6 months, but only 289 patients (29.4% of 983 who answered this question) had received the medication at adequate dose for at least 2 months. A total of 465 patients (46.3%) had received some counseling with at least 1 element of CBT, but only 213 patients (21.2%) had received counseling with a strong (3+ elements) CBT focus. Overall, 416 patients (41.4%) had received quality pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, and 81 patients (8.1%) had received both. Only 432 patients (44.8% of 964 who answered this question) were at least somewhat satisfied with their mental health care. Receipt of quality psychotherapy was the sole positive predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.71; 95% CI, 1.94-3.80; P < .0005) of satisfaction with mental health care for anxiety. Moreover, there was a dose-response relationship between the number of CBT elements consistently delivered and satisfaction with care (test for trend, z = 4.06, P < .0005). Conclusions: Despite recognition of these patients' anxiety disorders and referral by their PCPs to an anxiety treatment study, fewer than half of the patients had in the prior 6 months received quality pharmacologic and/or psychosocial mental health care. Receipt of CBT-oriented, quality psychosocial (but not pharmacologic) care showed a strong dose-response relationship with satisfaction with mental health care. © Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Little is known about whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or pharmacotherapy is relatively more advantageous for depressive versus anxiety disorders. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis wherein we searched electronic databases and references to select randomized controlled studies comparing CBT and pharmacotherapy, with or without placebo, in adults with major depressive or anxiety disorders. The primary effect size was calculated from disorder-specific outcome measures as the difference between CBT and pharmacotherapy outcomes (i.e., positive effect size favors CBT; negative effect size favors pharmacotherapy). Results: Twenty-one anxiety (N = 1,266) and twenty-one depression (N = 2,027) studies comparing medication to CBT were included. Including all anxiety disorders, the overall effect size was.25 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.55, P =.07). Effects for panic disorder significantly favored CBT over medications (.50, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.98). Obsessive-compulsive disorder showed similar effects-sizes, though not statistically significant (.49, 95% CI: -0.11, 1.09). Medications showed a nonsignificant advantage for social anxiety disorder (-.22, 95% CI: -0.50, 0.06). The overall effect size for depression studies was.05 (95% CI: -0.09, 0.19), with no advantage for medications or CBT. Pooling anxiety disorder and depression studies, the omnibus comparison of the relative difference between anxiety and depression in effectiveness for CBT versus pharmacotherapy pointed to a nonsignificant advantage for CBT in anxiety versus depression (B =.14, 95% CI: -0.14, 0.43). Conclusions: On balance, the evidence presented here indicates that there are at most very modest differences in effects of CBT versus pharmacotherapy in the treatment of anxiety versus depressive disorders. There seems to be larger differences between the anxiety disorders in terms of their relative responsiveness to pharmacotherapy versus CBT. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={• Objective: To review the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of social phobia. • Methods: Review of the literature and illustration of concepts via case presentation. • Results: Social anxiety disorder, or social phobia, is a chronic disorder that impairs functioning and results in a marked decrease in quality of life. The onset of social phobia typically occurs in early to mid adolescence, making it difficult to establish or maintain relationships at a time when social support is particularly important. A number of assessment measures and modalities can assist clinicians in accurately identifying and diagnosing social anxiety disorder. Depression, other anxiety disorders, and avoidant personality disorder should be considered. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most widely researched treatment for social anxiety disorder and is efficacious in treating individuals suffering from the disorder. While the efficacy of a number of psychotropic medications has been demonstrated for the treatment of social phobia, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (NSRIs) are safer, have fewer side effects than other medications, and may be better first-line pharmacological treatments. Consumers and clinicians should be aware that medication discontinuation often leads to relapse, whereas CBT is more durable over time and may be helpful for relapse prevention. • Conclusion: Appropriate and evidence-based assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of social anxiety disorder can improve outcomes for this often disabling but treatable condition.

abstract={This article reviews the current screening and assessment tools for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, as well as evidence-based treatment interventions for these disorders. The following anxiety disorders are discussed: separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and selective mutism. There are several well-studied screening and assessment tools to identify childhood anxiety disorders early and differentiate the various anxiety disorders. Evaluations of baseline somatic symptoms, severity, and impairment ratings of the anxiety disorders, and collecting ratings from several sources is clinically helpful in assessment and treatment follow-up. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been extensively studied and has shown good efficacy in treatment of childhood anxiety disorders. A combination of CBT and medication may be required for moderate to severely impairing anxiety disorders and may improve functioning better than either intervention alone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are currently the only medications that have consistently shown efficacy in treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Despite proven efficacy, the availability of CBT in the community is limited. Current research is focusing on early identification of anxiety disorders in community settings, increasing the availability of evidence-based interventions, and modification of interventions for specific populations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Objective: This study in cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) was to demonstrate the preparation of the patient with panic disorder for agoraphobic exposures. Techniques have been used for exhibitions interceptive their own bodily sensations and in vivo exposure to feared situations or places. Methodology: 50 individuals divided in two Groups of 25 participants each one. Group 1 undertook 10 weekly, individual sessions of CBT of one hour duration with use of medication. Group 2, control, only used medication without CBT. The medication prescribed consisted of tricyclic anti-depressants and selective inhibitors of the re-uptake of serotonin. At the beginning and at the end of the medical and psychological interventions evaluation instruments were applied. Results: We observed a significant difference between baseline and final in a group 1, such as: reduction in panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia avoidance and fear of bodily sensations. In the global assessment of functioning scale, an increase in the overall well-being of 60.8% to 72.5% among patients in group 1 with therapy, unlike the second group 2 without therapy. Conclusion: The procedures used for exposures, were considered essential in the preparation of patients with panic disorder, to be able to face up to panic attacks and subsequent agoraphobic situations.},

abstract={objective: To compare patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia treated with cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) associated with the medication with patients treated only with medication and verify the behaviour of the cardio-respiratory symptoms of both groups. Methods: Randomized sample in the Psychiatry Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, divided in two groups of 25 participants each. Group 1 undertook 10 weekly sessions of CBT with one hour of duration each together with medication. Group 2, Control, were administered medication that only consisted of tricyclic anti-depressants and selective inhibitors of the re-uptake of serotonin. Evaluation instruments were applied at the beginning and to the end of the interventions. Results: According to the applied scales, group 1 showed statistically more significant results than group 2, with: reduction of panic attacks, cardio-respiratory symptoms, anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia avoidance and fear of bodily sensations. Conclusion: Exposures (in vivo and interoceptive), especially for induction symptom exercises and relaxation, were considered essential to prepare patients with panic disorder to handle future cardio-respiratory symptoms and panic attacks with agoraphobia.},

abstract={Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents that form of psychotherapy which has most research data to build on in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders for adults. In this review we will introduce CBT and present the results of pertinent outcome research. Efficacy at the end of treatment is discussed, as well as long term effectiveness and the efficacy of combined treatment with medication and CBT. In addition, we discuss the pros and cons of group CBT compared to CBT in individual format, and comorbidity of mental disorders. According to this review CBT is efficacious for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia and specific phobia. Efficacy of CBT is equal to or better than efficacy of drugs in the treatment of the above disorders, but there is less access to CBT. Longterm effectiveness of CBT appears to be good, but research on combined treatment is yet in its infancy and conclusions are premature on its place in treatment.},

abstract={Until the mid-1960s, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was considered to be treatment-resistant, as both psychodynamic psychotherapy and medication had been unsuccessful in significantly reducing OCD symptoms. The first real breakthrough came in 1966 with the introduction of exposure and ritual prevention. This paper will discuss the cognitive behavioral conceptualizations that influenced the development of cognitive behavioral treatments for OCD. There will be a brief discussion of the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy and early behavioral therapy, neither of which produced successful outcomes with OCD. The main part of the paper will be devoted to current cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with an emphasis on variants of exposure and ritual or response prevention (EX/RP) treatments, the therapy that has shown the most empirical evidence of its efficacy. © 2010, LLS SAS.

abstract={The goal of the current case study was to illustrate an evidence-based assessment and the cognitive-behavioral treatment of an 11-year-old male with emetophobia. A multimodal assessment of the child's anxiety symptoms was conducted, including a semistructured diagnostic interview (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule: Child and Parent Versions), parent report (Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition.), and child self-report (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and Child Depression Inventory). Emetophobia symptoms were assessed via parent and child report of the Emetophobia Questionnaire. Treatment included graduated exposure, cognitive restructuring, and parent training. Improvement was seen within 22 sessions and maintained at a 6 months follow-up. In addition to a reduction in symptoms of emetophobia, discontinuation of medication, and no longer meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) criteria for specific phobia, treatment gains also included a reduction in internalizing and somatization symptoms as well as an increase in the patient's adaptive skills. This case study illustrates the use of CBT along with parent training as an efficacious treatment for children with emetophobia. It also demonstrates how to incorporate simple, everyday technology (i.e., Internet) to simulate exposures that are otherwise difficult to duplicate in the therapy session. © The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={Context: Improving the quality of mental health care requires moving clinical interventions from controlled research settings into real-world practice settings. Although such advances have been made for depression, little work has been performed for anxiety disorders. Objective: To determine whether a flexible treatment-delivery model for multiple primary care anxiety disorders (panic, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders) would be better than usual care (UC). Design, Setting, and Patients: A randomized controlled effectiveness trial of Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) compared with UC in 17 primary care clinics in 4 US cities. Between June 2006 and April 2008, 1004 patients with anxiety disorders (with or without major depression), aged 18 to 75 years, English- or Spanish-speaking, were enrolled and subsequently received treatment for 3 to 12 months. Blinded follow-up assessments at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline were completed in October 2009. Intervention CALM allowed choice of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medication, or both; included real-time Web-based outcomes monitoring to optimize treatment decisions; and a computer-assisted program to optimize delivery of CBT by non-expert care managers who also assisted primary care clinicians in promoting adherence and optimizing medications. Main Outcome Measures: Twelve-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-12) anxiety and somatic symptoms score. Secondary out comes included proportion of responders (≥50% reduction from pretreatment BSI-12 score) and remitters (total BSI-12 score <6). Results: A significantly greater improvement for CALM vs UC in global anxiety symptoms was found (BSI-12 group mean differences of -2.49 [95% confidence interval {CI}, -3.59 to -1.40], -2.63 [95% CI, -3.73 to -1.54], and -1.63 [95% CI, -2.73 to -0.53] at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively). At 12 months, response and remission rates (CALM vs UC) were 63.66% (95% CI, 58.95%-68.37%) vs 44.68% (95% CI, 39.76%-49.59%), and 51.49% (95% CI, 46.60%-56.38%) vs 33.28% (95% CI, 28.62%-37.93%), with a number needed to treat of 5.27 (95% CI, 4.18-7.13) for response and 5.50 (95% CI, 4.32-7.55) for remission. Conclusion: For patients with anxiety disorders treated in primary care clinics, CALM compared with UC resulted in greater improvement in anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, functional disability, and quality of care during 18 months of follow-up.

abstract={Introduction Over the past three decades, a dramatic expansion of research on social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, has yielded an emerging consensus on first-line evidence-based pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (Ballenger et al. 1998, Ipser et al. 2008, Powers et al. 2008). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (Effexor XR) each help a majority of patients with SAD, as demonstrated in short-term randomized controlled trials of 8–12 weeks. Cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) in several forms, administered over 12–24 weeks, yields roughly similar response rates in controlled trials. Gains have been shown to be well maintained during continuation therapy with medication for up to a year (e.g., Stein et al. 2003) and at follow-up assessments after a course of CBT for up to five years (e.g., Heimberg et al. 1993). Beyond this consensus, however, many aspects of the treatment of SAD remain poorly understood. Little is known about predictors of response to specific treatments. Relapse after treatment discontinuation appears more common after pharmacotherapy, but individualized predictors of which patients are vulnerable to relapse are lacking. Although SAD tends to be highly chronic, few treatment studies have followed patients for more than a year, and although SAD usually occurs with comorbid disorders, few studies have examined the impact of comorbidity on treatment outcome. © Cambridge University Press 2010.},

abstract={There has long been interest in combining pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). More recently, basic research on fear extinction has led to interest in augmentation of CBT with the N-methyl Daspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor partial agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) for anxiety disorders. In this article, the literature on clinical trials that have combined pharmacotherapy and CBT is briefly reviewed, focusing particularly on the anxiety disorders. The literature on CBT and DCS is then systematically reviewed. A series of randomized placebo-controlled trials on panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia suggest that low dose DCS before therapy sessions may be more effective compared with CBT alone in certain anxiety disorders. The strong translational foundation of this work is compelling, and the positive preliminary data gathered so far encourage further work. Issues for future research include delineating optimal dosing, and demonstrating effectiveness in real-world settings. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective: Anxiety disorders are common and have negative impact on the individual, the health system and the society. In practice a substantial percentage of patients remain untreated and those who are treated mostly receive either pharmacotherapy or CBT as monotherapy or in combination. This article aims at reviewing the available evidence for and against combination therapy in anxiety disorders with special emphasis on panic disorder and explores possible mechanisms of how cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy interact. Method: The article reviews available evidence for combination therapy in panic disorder and putative interactions between CBT and pharmacotherapy for panic disorder as well as for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on meta-analytic level. Results: There is no high-quality data that favours combination therapy in PTSD or combination of CBT with antipsychotics or anticonvulsants. In panic disorder, GAD, SAD and OCD combined treatment with antidepressants or benzodiazepines may result in greater effectiveness during the acute phase and post-treatment but treatment gains appear not to be durable compared to CBT monotherapy. Some evidence suggests that combination with some types of medication may actually be detrimental to long-term outcome. Effects on the neuronal fear network and memory function as well as attribution of improvement and patients' attitudes towards treatment are possible factors in understanding the complex interaction between psychotropic medication and CBT. Conclusions: Combination therapy in anxiety disorders may be clinically over-used considering the current evidence base while CBT monotherapy appears underutilized. The complex interaction between pharmacotherapy and CBT should be considered in treatment planning.},

abstract={While effective psychotropic medications have been introduced more than 50 years ago and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as the most evidence-based psychotherapy was introduced for depression about 40 years ago substantial uncertainty continues to exist about the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. On the one hand both forms of therapy had to first prove their effectiveness individually, and while there is no doubt that both therapeutic approaches are beneficial in some way the quest is ongoing to refine both the psychotherapeutic treatment protocols as well as the pharmacological agents as monotherapies. On the other hand, in many health systems there has often been a divide between the clinician, who prescribes medication -often a general practioner or psychiatrist - and the clinician who delivers psychotherapy - often a psychologist or trained nurse. This divide may have contributed to the relative paucity of studies regarding combined treatment although in clinical reality most patients starting psychotherapy have had some experience with pharmacological treatments. This article focuses on the evidence regarding combination therapy in depression and in anxiety disorders and attempts to give some practical guidelines for clinical management.},

abstract={Pediatric generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about a variety of events and is accompanied by physical symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, and heart palpitations. Symptoms impose marked distress and interfere with social, emotional, and educational functioning. GAD occurs in over 10 of children and adolescents, has an average age of onset of 8.5 years, and is more often reported in girls. Common co-occurring conditions include separation anxiety disorder and social phobia.Assessment involves a multi-informant, multi-method approach involving the child, parents, and school teachers. A clinical interview should be conducted to assess for the three primary ways anxiety presents: behaviors, thoughts, and somatic symptoms. Several semi-structured diagnostic interviews are available, and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule is increasingly used. Rating scales completed by the patient, caregivers, and teachers provide useful information for diagnosis and symptom monitoring. Several scales are available to assess patients for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition) GAD diagnosis; however, instruments generally cannot distinguish children with GAD from children with similar anxiety disorders.Both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders including GAD. Evidence suggests that the combination of CBT plus sertraline offers additional benefit compared with either treatment alone. With pharmacotherapy, systematic tracking of treatment-emergent adverse events such as headaches, stomach aches, behavioral activation, worsening symptoms, and emerging suicidal thoughts is important. Recommended starting doses are fluvoxamine 25mgday, fluoxetine 10mgday, and sertraline 25mgday, though lower starting doses are possible. Dosing can be adjusted as often as weekly with the goal of achieving a high-quality response, while minimizing side effects. Long-term treatment with medication has not been well studied; however, to achieve optimal long-term outcome extended use of medication may be required. It is recommended to continue medication for approximately 1 year following remission in symptoms, and when discontinuing medication to choose a stress-free time of the year. If symptoms return, medication re-initiation should be considered seriously. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD/A) is common and can be treated effectively with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication or cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT). However, the lack of access to CBT services has motivated the development of self-help approaches requiring less therapist contact. A novel treatment modality in this field, showing efficacy in several randomized trials but until now not evaluated within the context of regular psychiatric care, is Internet-based treatment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Internet-based CBT for patients in a psychiatric setting. Twenty consecutively referred patients with PD were included in the study. A structured clinical interview with a psychiatrist was conducted for inclusion, as well as at post-treatment and at the 6-month follow-up. The treatment consisted of a 10-week CBT-based self-help programme, including minimal therapist support by e-mail. At post-treatment, 94% of patients no longer met DSM-IV criteria for PD (82% at 6-month follow-up). The within-group effect sizes (for the main outcome PDSS; Panic Disorder Severity Scale) were Cohen's d=2.5 (pre- to post-treatment) and 2.8 (pre-treatment to follow-up), respectively. The proportion of responders on the PDSS was 75% at post-treatment and 70% at 6-month follow-up. The results supports earlier efficacy data on Internet-based CBT for PD and indicates that it is effective also within a regular psychiatric setting. However, a larger randomized controlled trial should be conducted, directly comparing Internet-based CBT with traditionally administered CBT within such a setting.},

abstract={In this report, which is an update of a guideline published in 2002 (Bandelow et al. 2002, World J Biol Psychiatry 3:171), recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are presented. Since the publication of the first version of this guideline, a substantial number of new randomized controlled studies of anxiolytics have been published. In particular, more relapse prevention studies are now available that show sustained efficacy of anxiolytic drugs. The recommendations, developed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Post-traumatic Stress Disorders, a consensus panel of 30 international experts, are now based on 510 published randomized, placebo- or comparator-controlled clinical studies (RCTs) and 130 open studies and case reports. First-line treatments for these disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and the calcium channel modulator pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are equally effective for some disorders, but many are less well tolerated than the SSRIs/SNRIs. In treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines may be used when the patient does not have a history of substance abuse disorders. Potential treatment options for patients unresponsive to standard treatments are described in this overview. Although these guidelines focus on medications, non-pharmacological were also considered. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and other variants of behaviour therapy have been sufficiently investigated in controlled studies in patients with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD to support them being recommended either alone or in combination with the above medicines.},

abstract={This study investigated the extent to which occasional cannabis use moderated anxiety and depression outcomes in the Collaborative Care for Anxiety and Panic (CCAP) study, a combined cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy randomized effectiveness trial. Participants were 232 adults from six university-based primary care outpatient clinics in three West Coast cities randomized to receive either the CCAP intervention or the usual care condition. Results showed significant (P<.01) evidence of an interaction between treatment group (CCAP vs. usual care) and cannabis use status (monthly vs. less than monthly) for depressive symptoms, but not for panic disorder or social phobia symptoms (all P>.05). Monthly cannabis users' depressive symptoms improved in the CCAP intervention just as much as those who used cannabis less than monthly, whereas monthly users receiving usual care had significantly more depressive symptoms than those using less than monthly. A combined CBT and medication treatment intervention may be a promising approach for the treatment of depression among occasional cannabis users. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={In a particular success for translational research agendas, characterization of the neuronal circuits underlying fear extinction, and basic research in animal extinction paradigms, has led to intervention studies examining the use of D-cycloserine (DCS) to enhance therapeutic learning from exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). In this article, we review these intervention studies, and discuss DCS augmentation of CBT relative to more traditional combination-treatment strategies in the treatment of anxiety disorders. We offer an accounting, based on evidence for internal context effects, of current limitations in the combination of antidepressant or benzodiazepine medications with CBT and discuss the advantages of isolated-dosing strategies with DCS relative to these limitations. This strategy is contrasted with the chronic-dosing applications of DCS for schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, and future directions for isolated-dosing strategies are discussed.},

abstract={This review attempts to integrate information and methods from CBT, family therapy and pharmacotherapy orientations, in the treatment of six adult anxiety disorders, and separation anxiety in pediatric populations. Anxiety disorders have been under-recognized and undertreated, in part because practitioners of different orientations have too often worked in isolation from one another. Both CBT and pharmacotherapy are evidence-supported treatments. However, the effectiveness of CBT can be enhanced if it is provided within a family therapy context. Similarly, medications can be an important treatment partner in the management of anxiety disorders. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The neurobiology of the anxiety disorders, which include panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and specific phobias, among others, has been clarified by advances in the field of classical or Pavlovian conditioning, and in our understanding of basic mechanisms of memory and learning. Fear conditioning occurs when a neutral conditioned stimulus (such as a tone) is paired with an aversive, or unconditioned stimulus (such as a footshock), and then in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus, causes a conditioned fear response. Preclinical studies have shown that the amygdala plays a key role in fear circuitry, and that abnormalities in amygdala pathways can affect the acquisition and expression of fear conditioning. Drugs such as glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, and blockers of voltage-gated calcium channels, in the amygdala, may block these effects. There is also preliminary evidence for the use of centrally acting beta-adrenergic antagonists, like propranolol, to inhibit consolidation of traumatic memories in PTSD. Finally, fear extinction, which entails new learning of fear inhibition, is central to the mechanism of effective anti-anxiety treatments. Several pharmacological manipulations, such as D-cycloserine, a partial NMDA agonist, have been found to facilitate extinction. Combining these medication approaches with psychotherapies that promote extinction, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), may offer patients with anxiety disorders a rapid and robust treatment with good durability of effect. © The Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine.},

abstract={Non-response to pharmacotherapy for panic disorder (PD) is a well-documented problem. However, little information exists to guide next-step strategies for these non-responders. In addition to pharmacologic augmentation strategies, several studies support the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for these patients, although data on long-term outcomes has been lacking. In this study, we provide one-year outcomes on a sample of 63 patients who completed group CBT for PD after failing to respond adequately to previous pharmacotherapy. Sustained significant benefit was found for all dimensional outcome scores, and nearly two-thirds of the sample met remission criteria. This occurred with reductions in medication use over the follow-up period. Negative predictors of remission status included comorbid dysthymia, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. These results provide additional evidence for the efficacy of CBT for medication non-responders with PD. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Anxiety disorders in the United States are prevalent, widespread, and disabling. These illnesses may account for almost one third of the $148 billion total mental health bill each year. Pharmacologic options include tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anxiolytics. Psychological treatments include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive therapy, exposure, and ritual prevention therapies. Despite insufficient evidence, many experts recommend combined treatment, generally medication with CBT. A literature review was conducted to examine studies with random assignment, adequate methods and sample sizes, blind assessments, sufficient dosages and durations of treatment, and satisfactory reporting of data, to determine whether combined treatment was superior to monotherapy. Twenty-six randomized clinical trials were identified; nine met review criteria. A review of relevant studies could not confirm the superiority of combined treatment over monotherapy. In one of four studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder, combined treatment produced better results than monotherapy. There was no evidence of superiority for combined therapy over monotherapy for the treatment of social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder. There were no studies that met review criteria for either specific phobia or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). With panic disorder, there was evidence that combined treatment might actually lead to worse outcome. Combined treatment is commonly recommended, but empirical support is limited. More research is needed. There are few well-designed studies, and little data regarding PTSD and specific phobias.},

abstract={Although the focus of clinical and research interest has increased over the past decade, treatment development research for child and adolescent anxiety disorders continues to lag behind many other childhood disorders. Nevertheless, some advances have been made, perhaps most notably, the establishment of cognitive-behavior therapy as an efficacious and durable treatment for these conditions. CBT has demonstrated acute efficacy in individual, group, family, and school-based formats, with follow-up studies that provide impressive evidence for the durability of treatment gains up to 7 years post-treatment [44]. Despite the progress to date, additional research, some of which is ongoing, is needed to address key outstanding issues. These issues include the use of more stringent (ie, non-wait-list) comparison groups, studies examining the portability of CBT from academic to community treatment settings, and better delineation of possible treatment mechanisms and predictors of outcome, including the impact of comorbidity on response. Given the recent documentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication as an efficacious treatment for child anxiety (eg, the RUPP Anxiety Study Group [72]), clinical trials examining the comparative and combined efficacy of CBT and medication are needed, as is research delineating guidelines for sequencing these treatments. The National Institute of Mental Health Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multisite Treatment Study comparing the efficacy of CBT, SSRI medication, CBT plus SSRI, and pill placebo is underway and will provide answers to many of these outstanding research questions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Affective symptoms are often present and under-treated in schizophrenia. This case study reports the effect of treatment of a specific phobia and associated avoidance on the psychotic symptoms of a patient with medication resistant schizophrenia. The treatment of the specific phobia and agoraphobia followed a traditional systematic desensitization procedure. The successful treatment of the phobias led to improvements in psychotic symptoms. Previously, the client had only a limited response to a number of antipsychotic medications including clozapine but responded well to a traditional systematic desensitization program that produced positive consequences for the psychotic symptomatology. The clinical and theoretical aspects of this case are discussed. © 2005 British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies.},

abstract={Objective: The authors hypothesized that patients with late-life anxiety undergoing cognitive-behavioral therapy plus medical management for medication taper (CBT-MM) would realize greater reduction in medication use and greater improvement in psychological symptoms than a control group undergoing medical management alone (MM). Methods: Forty-two patients (age >60) who wanted to reduce anxiolytic medication were allocated to the two groups (CBT-MM versus MM), using a randomization plus difference-minimization procedure (to equate for medication use). Results: CBT-MM completers significantly reduced medication use, but not at a greater rate than MM completers. At the same time, CBT-MM completers experienced significantly greater alleviation of psychological symptoms than did MM completers. Some, but not all, treatment gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analyses using the mixed-effects model showed similar, but weaker, treatment effects than completer analyses. Conclusions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy can alleviate psychological symptoms in elderly patients with anxiety even as patients reduce anxiolytic medication. © 2005 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.},

abstract={Despite scant evidence of an advantage of combining medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder, the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches suggest the possibility that some form of combination may be helpful for many clients. At the same time, the available evidence and theoretical considerations suggest that some methods of combination could provide short-term benefits but long-term decreases in efficacy compared to either treatment alone. Thus, current knowledge suggests that, for social anxiety disorder, more treatment is no substitute for well-informed treatment. We provide guidelines for treatment based on available evidence, theoretical models, and clinical experience. Overall, the clearest case for combination treatment is for the addition of an empirically supported CBT for social anxiety disorder following the stabilization of response to an empirically supported psychopharmacological agent. The CBT should then be modified to address the use of medication, the possibility of relapse, and, ideally, the tapering of medication during CBT. Further research is called for in order to support these recommendations and extend the available literature. © 2005 Springer Publishing Company.},

abstract={Objective: To review the empirical status of psychological treatments for social phobia (SP), commenting both on cognitive-behavioural interventions and on more recent iterations of those approaches. We also review the effective components of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). Method: We qualitatively reviewed the empirical literature on the psychological treatment of SP. We include empirical studies, metaanalyses, and recent conference presentations in this review. Results: Cognitive and behavioural interventions for SP appear to be more effective than wait-list controls and supportive therapy. Comparisons of CBT and pharmacologic treatment have produced inconsistent results. Several new treatments for SP demonstrate promising results. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that various psychosocial treatments for SP are better than wait-list controls and credible placebo interventions. Ongoing projects investigate the relative efficacy of combining medication and psychosocial treatments over monotherapies; this line of research is important to continue. Further research should also focus on which components of CBT are most effective.},

abstract={Objective: This is a naturalistic treatment outcome study investigating the impact of pre-existing antidepressant use on the effectiveness of group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for social phobia. Method: Of the 133 participants who completed the CBT program, 49 reported taking antidepressants (CBT + AD group), while 84 reported not taking antidepressants (CBT group). The treatment program involves 40 h of structured, group-based CBT over 7 weeks. The dependent measures included the Social Phobia Scale and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and the Short Form-12. Results: Both the CBT + AD group and the CBT group improved significantly across treatment on all dependent measures. There were no significant differences between the groups on any outcome measure and the rate of improvement from pre- to post-treatment for both groups did not differ. Conclusions: Pre-existing antidepressants did not significantly enhance or detract from the positive treatment outcome of a structured, group-based CBT program for social phobia.},

abstract={We review the available treatments for social anxiety disorder, focusing primarily on psychotherapeutic interventions for adults, but also giving briefer summaries of pharmacological treatments and treatments for children and adolescents. The most well-researched psychosocial treatments for social anxiety disorder are cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs), and meta-analyses indicate that all forms of CBT appear likely to provide some benefit for adults. In addition, there are several pharmacological treatments with demonstrated efficacy, and cognitive-behavioral interventions have some demonstrated efficacy for children and adolescents. We outline a number of concerns regarding this literature, including the questions of what influences treatment response and what role combinations of CBT and medication might have. Clearly, although a number of treatments appear well-established in regard to their effects on social anxiety disorder, a number of opportunities for future research remain, including the search for predictors of who will benefit from which treatment. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent, are increasing in incidence, affect individuals early in life, and significantly impact health care and quality of life. As such, they are serious public health problems that deserve attention now and in the future. Over the last 10-20 years, there has been marked improvement in pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions for anxiety. Due to their broad spectrum of efficacy against common comorbidities and lack of association with abuse and dependence, serotonergic and mixed serotonergic noradrenergic antidepressants are first-line therapies for anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines are still widely used in clinical practice because they are well tolerated and work quickly and effectively. Other medications that are emerging as potentially useful for selected populations with anxiety include atypical neuroleptics, and anticonvulsants. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is at least as effective as medication for many patients with anxiety disorders and facilitates maintenance of benefit over the long term. Resilience, the capacity to bounce back from adversity, can be reliably measured with a psychometrically valid scale, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Compared with the general population, individuals with anxiety disorders exhibit decreased resilience. Studies have shown that pharmacologic treatment combined with CBT may increase resilience within 2-3 months. Emerging neurobiologic research indicates that noradrenergic pathways and 5-HT2 transporter efficiency may mediate effects on resiliency.},

abstract={Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy demonstrate efficacy across the anxiety disorders, but recognition of their limitations has sparked interest in combining modalities to maximize benefit. This article reviews the empirical literature to examine whether combining treatments influences efficacy of either monotherapy. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of published randomized trials that compared combined treatment with pharmacologic or CBT monotherapies. Ten studies that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed in detail, and within-subjects effect sizes were calculated to compare treatment conditions within and across studies. At posttreatment and follow-up, effect size and percentage responder data failed to clearly demonstrate an advantage or disadvantage of combined treatment over CBT alone for obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. Some advantage of combined treatment over pharmacotherapy alone emerged from the few studies that allowed for such a direct comparison. In contrast, combined treatment for panic disorder seems to provide an advantage over CBT alone at posttreatment, but is associated with greater relapse after treatment discontinuation. The advantage of combined treatment may vary across the anxiety disorders. The potential differences in usefulness of combined treatment are discussed, directions for future research are suggested, and implications for clinical practice are considered. © 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract={Social anxiety disorder is prevalent, potentially disabling, but quite treatable. A thorough and directed history can distinguish social phobia from depression, panic disorder, and OCD. It can also screen for and identify possible substance abuse. Once the diagnosis is made, a combination of pharmacologic and psychotherapy is indicated. The SSRIs, MAOIs, benzodiazepines, and beta-blockers--as well as CBT--can effectively treat social anxiety symptoms. Primary care physicians may well want to begin by prescribing an SSRI like paroxetine, along with a high potency benzodiazepine to be taken on a regular or an as-needed basis, and a beta-blocker to take as needed in anticipation of stressful social situations. A referral for CBT should be considered. If the patient has marked side effects from drug treatment or a lack of adequate response to medication, psychiatric referral is definitely indicated.},

abstract={Background: The efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in social phobia has been demonstrated in several controlled trials and meta-analyses, but no comparison of CBT with supportive therapy (ST) can be found in the literature. Method: The aim of the trial was to study the effectiveness of CBT versus ST carried out 'as usual'. Sixty-seven DSM-4 social phobic patients (89% generalized subtype, most with avoidant personality) were randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1 (CBT) received 8 1-hour sessions of individual cognitive therapy (CT) for 6 weeks, followed by 6 2-hr sessions of social skills training (SST) in group weekly. Group 2 received ST for 12 weeks (6 half-hour sessions), then the patients were switched to CBT. All patients agreed not to take any medication during the whole trial. In group 1, 29 patients reached week 6, 27 reached week 12, and 24 weeks 36 and 60 (endpoint). In group 2, 29 patients reached week 6, 28 reached weeks 12 and 18, 26 week 24, and 23 reached weeks 48 and 72 (endpoint). Results: At week 6, after CT, group 1 was better than group 2 on the main social phobia measure. At week 12, after SST, group 1 was better than group 2 on most of the measures and demonstrated a significantly higher rate of responders. This finding was replicated after switching group 2 to CBT. Sustained improvement was observed in both groups at follow-up. Compliance with abstinence from medication increased over time. Conclusions: CBT was more effective than ST and demonstrated long-lasting effects. This may suggest that social phobia management requires more than a simple and inexpensive psychological intervention. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={A number of empirical studies document the growing clinical and scientific interest in combining cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychopharmacologic treatment in anxiety disorders. Potential advantages and disadvantages of combined therapies are described. A review of existing studies with combined treatments for the different subtypes of anxiety disorders is given. There are no empirical data showing that compared with CBT alone combinations are superior in specific and social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder. In panic disorder and agoraphobia some studies show better results (an earlier response to treatment) for CBT plus medication compared to CBT plus placebo in the short run. In follow-up studies success rates are independent from the former treatment groups. Several studies show that CBT methods are necessary for long-term stabilization after drug discontinuation and for the prevention of relapses. Taken together CBT is shown to be helpful as an adjunct to psychopharma-cotherapy, necessary for successful drug discontinuation, long-term stabilization, and an alternative treatment to psychopharmacotherapy. Considering the long-term results, CBT should be the treatment of choice if the patient is motivated for this active form of therapy and no practical constraints limit this option. Parallel combinations of CBT and medication in anxiety disorders should be limited to special indications, e.g. very severe comorbidity or the need for an immediate symptom relief. Sequential therapy strategies for CBT non-responders need further investigation.},

abstract={Social phobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by heightened fear and avoidance of one or more social or performance situations, including public speaking, meeting new people, eating or writing in front of others, and attending social gatherings. People with social phobia are typically anxious about the possibility that others will evaluate them negatively and/or notice symptoms of their anxiety. Social phobia affects up to 13% of individuals at some time in their lives and is usually associated with at least moderate functional impairment. Research on the nature and treatment of social phobia has increased dramatically over the past decade. As with many of the anxiety disorders, sensitive assessment instruments and effective treatments now exist for people suffering from heightened social anxiety. Typical assessment strategies include clinical interviews, behavioural assessments, monitoring diaries, and self-report questionnaires. Treatments with demonstrated efficacy for social phobia include pharmacotherapy (for example, phenelzine, moclobemide, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medications) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (for example, cognitive restructuring, in vivo exposure, social skills training). Although preliminary comparative studies suggest that both approaches are about equally effective in the short term, each approach has advantages and disadvantages over the other. Trials examining combined psychological and pharmacological treatments are now under way, although no published data on the relative efficacy of combined treatments are currently available.},
